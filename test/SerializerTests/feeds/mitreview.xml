<p>At long last, OpenAI has released GPT-5. The new system abandons the distinction between OpenAI‚Äôs flagship models and its o series of reasoning models, automatically routing user queries to a fast nonreasoning model or a slower reasoning version. It is now available to everyone through the ChatGPT web interface‚Äîthough nonpaying users may need to wait a few days to gain full access to the new capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>It‚Äôs tempting to compare GPT-5 with its explicit predecessor, GPT-4, but the more illuminating juxtaposition is with o1, OpenAI‚Äôs first reasoning model, which was <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/17/1104004/why-openais-new-model-is-such-a-big-deal/">released last year</a>. In contrast to GPT-5‚Äôs broad release, o1 was initially available only to Plus and Team subscribers. Those users got access to a completely new kind of language model‚Äîone that would ‚Äúreason‚Äù through its answers by generating additional text before providing a final response, enabling it to solve much more challenging problems than its nonreasoning counterparts.</p><p>Whereas o1 was a major technological advancement, GPT-5 is, above all else, a refined product. During a press briefing, Sam Altman compared GPT-5 to Apple‚Äôs Retina displays, and it‚Äôs an apt analogy, though perhaps not in the way that he intended. Much like an unprecedentedly crisp screen, GPT-5 will furnish a more pleasant and seamless user experience. That‚Äôs not nothing, but it falls far short of the transformative AI future that Altman has spent much of the past year hyping. In the briefing, Altman called GPT-5 ‚Äúa significant step along the path to AGI,‚Äù or artificial general intelligence, and maybe he‚Äôs right‚Äîbut if so, it‚Äôs a very small step.</p><p>Take the demo of the model‚Äôs abilities that OpenAI showed to <em>MIT Technology Review</em> in advance of its release. Yann Dubois, a post-training lead at OpenAI, asked GPT-5 to design a web application that would help his partner learn French so that she could communicate more easily with his family. The model did an admirable job of following his instructions and created an appealing, user-friendly app. But when I gave GPT-4o an almost identical prompt, it produced an app with exactly the same functionality. The only difference is that it wasn‚Äôt as aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>Some of the other user-experience improvements are more substantial. Having the model rather than the user choose whether to apply reasoning to each query removes a major pain point, especially for users who don‚Äôt follow LLM advancements closely.&nbsp;</p><p>And, according to Altman, GPT-5 reasons much faster than the o-series models. The fact that OpenAI is releasing it to nonpaying users suggests that it‚Äôs also less expensive for the company to run. That‚Äôs a big deal: Running powerful models cheaply and quickly is a tough problem, and solving it is key to reducing <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/ai-energy-package/">AI‚Äôs environmental impact</a>.¬†</p><p>OpenAI has also taken steps to mitigate <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/18/1093440/what-causes-ai-hallucinate-chatbots/">hallucinations</a>, which have been a persistent headache. OpenAI‚Äôs evaluations suggest that GPT-5 models are substantially less likely to make incorrect claims than their predecessor models, o3 and GPT-4o. If that advancement holds up to scrutiny, it could help pave the way for more reliable and trustworthy agents. ‚ÄúHallucination can cause real safety and security issues,‚Äù says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. For example, an agent that hallucinates software packages could download malicious code to a user‚Äôs device.</p><p>GPT-5 has achieved the state of the art on several benchmarks, including a test of agentic abilities and the coding evaluations SWE-Bench and Aider Polyglot. But according to Cl√©mentine Fourrier, an AI researcher at the company HuggingFace, those evaluations are nearing saturation, which means that current models have achieved close to maximal performance.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically like looking at the performance of a high schooler on middle-grade problems,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf the high schooler fails, it tells you something, but if it succeeds, it doesn‚Äôt tell you a lot.‚Äù Fourrier said she would be impressed if the system achieved a score of 80% or 85% on SWE-Bench‚Äîbut it only managed a 74.9%.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, the headline message from OpenAI is that GPT-5 feels better to use. ‚ÄúThe vibes of this model are really good, and I think that people are really going to feel that, especially average people who haven&#8217;t been spending their time thinking about models,‚Äù said Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT.</p><p>Vibes alone, however, won‚Äôt bring about the automated future that Altman has promised. Reasoning felt like a major step forward on the way to AGI. We‚Äôre still waiting for the next one.</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>In the spring of 2021, climate scientists were stumped.&nbsp;</p><p>The global economy was just emerging from the covid-19 lockdowns, but for some reason the levels of methane‚Äîa greenhouse gas emitted mainly through agriculture and fossil-fuel production‚Äîhad soared in the atmosphere the previous year, rising at the fastest rate on record.</p><p>Researchers around the world set to work unraveling the mystery, reviewing readings from satellites, aircraft, and greenhouse-gas monitoring stations. They <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150967/why-methane-surged-in-2020">eventually spotted</a> a clear pattern: <strong>Methane emissions had increased sharply across the tropics, where wetlands were growing wetter and warmer.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>That created the ideal conditions for microbes that thrive in anaerobic muck, which gobbled up more of the carbon-rich organic matter and spat out more methane as a by-product. (Reduced pollution from nitrogen oxides, which help to break down methane in the atmosphere, also likely played a substantial role.)</p><p><strong>The </strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55266-y"><strong>findings</strong></a><strong> offer one of the clearest cases so far where climate change itself is driving additional greenhouse-gas emissions from natural systems</strong>, triggering a feedback effect that threatens to produce more warming, more emissions, and on and on.&nbsp;</p><p>There are numerous additional ways this is happening or soon could, including wildfires and thawing permafrost. These are major emissions sources that aren‚Äôt included in the commitments nations have made under the Paris climate agreement‚Äîand climate risks that largely aren‚Äôt accounted for in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change‚Äôs most recent warming scenarios.</p><p>Spark Climate Solutions (not to be confused with this newsletter) hopes to change that.<br><br><strong>The San Francisco nonprofit is launching what‚Äôs known as a model intercomparison project,</strong> in which different research teams run the same set of experiments on different models across a variety of emissions scenarios to determine how climate change could play out. This one would specifically explore how a range of climate feedback effects could propel additional warming, additional emissions, and additional types of feedback.</p><p>‚ÄúThese increased emissions from natural sources add to human emissions and amplify climate change,‚Äù says Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, who previously served as <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/09/01/white-house-office-of-science-and-technology-policy-announces-dr-philip-duffy-as-climate-science-advisor/">climate science advisor</a> to President Joe Biden. <strong>‚ÄúAnd if you don‚Äôt look at all of them together, you can‚Äôt quantify the strength of that feedback effect.‚Äù</strong></p><p>Other participants in the effort will include scientists at the Environmental Defense Fund, Stanford University, the Woodwell Climate Research Center, and other institutions in Europe and Australia, according to Spark Climate Solutions.</p><p>The nonprofit hopes to publish the findings in time for them to be incorporated into the UN climate panel‚Äôs seventh major assessment report, which is just getting underway, to help ensure that these dangers are more fully represented. That, in turn, would give nations a more accurate sense of the world‚Äôs carbon budgets, or the quantity of greenhouse gases they can produce before the planet reaches temperatures 1.5 ¬∞C or&nbsp; 2 ¬∞C over preindustrial levels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>But one thing is already clear: Since the current scenarios don‚Äôt fully account for these feedback effects, the world will almost certainly warm faster than is now forecast</strong>, which underscores the importance of carrying out this exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>Scientists at EDF, Woodwell and other institutions found that fires in the world‚Äôs northernmost forests, thawing permafrost and warming tropical wetlands could together push the planet beyond 2 ¬∞C years faster, eliminating up to a quarter of the time left before the world passes the core goal of the Paris agreement, in <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5165213">a paper</a> under review.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, Spark Climate Solutions set up <a href="https://www.sparkclimate.org/warming-induced-emissions/home">a broader program</a> to advance research and awareness of what‚Äôs known as warming-induced emissions, which will launch additional collaborations similar to the modeling intercomparison project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of the program and the research project is ‚Äúto really mainstream the inclusion of this topic in climate science and climate policy, and to drive research around <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.17585">climate solutions</a>,‚Äù says Ben Poulter, who leads the program at Spark Climate Solutions and was previously a scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.</p><p>Spark notes that warming temperatures could also release more carbon dioxide from the oceans, in a process known as outgassing; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20150">additional carbon dioxide</a> and nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that also depletes the protective ozone layer, from farmland; more carbon dioxide and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56218-w">methane</a> from wildfires; and still more of <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-environ-012220-011847">all</a><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2100163118">three of</a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412025000480">these gases</a> as permafrost thaws.</p><p>The ground remains frozen year round across a vast expanse of the Northern Hemisphere, creating a frosty underground storehouse from Alaska to Siberia that‚Äôs packed with twice as much carbon as the atmosphere.</p><p><strong>But as it thaws, it starts to decompose and release greenhouse gases,</strong> says Susan Natali, an Arctic climate scientist focused on permafrost at Woodwell. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02234-5">study</a> published in <em>Nature</em> in January noted that 30% of the world‚Äôs Arctic‚ÄìBoreal Zone has already flipped from a carbon sink to a carbon source, when wildfires, thawing permafrost and other factors are taken into account.</p><p>Despite these increasing risks, only a minority of the models that fed into the UN climate panel‚Äôs last major report incorporated the feedback effects of thawing permafrost. And the emissions risks still weren‚Äôt fully accounted for because these ecosystems are difficult to monitor and model, Natali says.<br><br>Among the complexities: Wildfires, which are themselves hard to predict, can accelerate thawing. It‚Äôs also hard to foresee which regions will grow drier or wetter, which determines whether they release mostly methane or carbon dioxide‚Äîand those gases have very different warming effects over different time periods. There are counterbalancing effects that must be taken into account as well‚Äîfor instance, as carbon-absorbing plants replace ice and snow in certain areas.</p><p><strong>Natali says improving our understanding of these complex feedback effects is essential to understanding the dangers we face.</strong></p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to mean additional costs to human health, human life,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe want people to be safe‚Äîand it‚Äôs very hard to do that if you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming and you‚Äôre not prepared for it.‚Äù</p><p><em>This article is from The Spark,¬†</em>MIT Technology Review<em>‚Äôs weekly climate newsletter.

				<![CDATA[
<p>Last week, Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.meta.com/superintelligence/">declared</a> that Meta is aiming to achieve smarter-than-human AI. He seems to have a recipe for achieving that goal, and the first ingredient is human talent: Zuckerberg has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/technology/meta-new-ai-lab-superintelligence.html">reportedly</a> tried to lure top researchers to Meta Superintelligence Labs with nine-figure offers. The second ingredient is AI itself.&nbsp; Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-earnings-superintelligence-q2-2025/">recently said on an earnings call</a> that Meta Superintelligence Labs will be focused on building self-improving AI‚Äîsystems that can bootstrap themselves to higher and higher levels of performance.</p><p>The possibility of self-improvement distinguishes AI from other revolutionary technologies. CRISPR can‚Äôt improve its own targeting of DNA sequences, and fusion reactors can‚Äôt figure out how to make the technology commercially viable. But LLMs can optimize the computer chips they run on, train other LLMs cheaply and efficiently, and perhaps even come up with original ideas for AI research. And they‚Äôve already made some progress in all these domains.</p><p>According to Zuckerberg, AI self-improvement could bring about a world in which humans are liberated from workaday drudgery and can pursue their highest goals with the support of brilliant, hypereffective artificial companions. But self-improvement also creates a fundamental risk, according to Chris Painter, the policy director at the AI research nonprofit METR. If AI accelerates the development of its own capabilities, he says, it could rapidly get better at hacking, designing weapons, and manipulating people. Some researchers even speculate that this positive feedback cycle could lead to an ‚Äúintelligence explosion,‚Äù in which AI rapidly launches itself far beyond the level of human capabilities.</p><p>But you don‚Äôt have to be a doomer to take the implications of self-improving AI seriously. <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/openai-preparedness-framework-beta.pdf">OpenAI</a>, <a href="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/872c653b2d0501d6ab44cf87f43e1dc4853e4d37.pdf">Anthropic</a>, and <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/updating-the-frontier-safety-framework/Frontier%20Safety%20Framework%202.0.pdf">Google</a> all include references to automated AI research in their AI safety frameworks, alongside more familiar risk categories such as chemical weapons and cybersecurity. ‚ÄúI think this is the fastest path to powerful AI,‚Äù says Jeff Clune, a professor of computer science at the University of British Columbia and senior research advisor at Google DeepMind. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably the most important thing we should be thinking about.‚Äù</p><p>By the same token, Clune says, automating AI research and development could have enormous upsides. On our own, we humans might not be able to think up the innovations and improvements that will allow AI to one day tackle prodigious problems like cancer and climate change.</p><p>For now, human ingenuity is still the primary engine of AI advancement; otherwise, Meta would hardly have made such exorbitant offers to attract researchers to its superintelligence lab. But AI is already contributing to its own development, and it‚Äôs set to take even more of a role in the years to come. Here are five ways that AI is making itself better.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Enhancing productivity</strong></h3><p>Today, the most important contribution that LLMs make to AI development may also be the most banal. ‚ÄúThe biggest thing is coding assistance,‚Äù says Tom Davidson, a senior research fellow at Forethought, an AI research nonprofit. Tools that help engineers write software more quickly, such as Claude Code and Cursor, appear popular across the AI industry: Google CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/google-ceo-code-ai">claimed</a> in October 2024 that a quarter of the company‚Äôs new code was generated by AI, and Anthropic <a href="https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/58284b19e702b49db9302d5b6f135ad8871e7658.pdf">recently documented</a> a wide variety of ways that its employees use Claude Code. If engineers are more productive because of this coding assistance, they will be able to design, test, and deploy new AI systems more quickly.</p><p>But the productivity advantage that these tools confer remains uncertain: If engineers are spending large amounts of time correcting errors made by AI systems, they might not be getting any more work done, even if they are spending less of their time writing code manually. A <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">recent study</a> from METR found that developers take about 20% longer to complete tasks when using AI coding assistants, though Nate Rush, a member of METR‚Äôs technical staff who co-led the study, notes that it only examined extremely experienced developers working on large code bases. Its conclusions might not apply to AI researchers who write up quick scripts to run experiments.</p><p><br>Conducting a similar study within the frontier labs could help provide a much clearer picture of whether coding assistants are making AI researchers at the cutting edge more productive, Rush says‚Äîbut that work hasn‚Äôt yet been undertaken. In the meantime, just taking software engineers‚Äô word for it isn‚Äôt enough: The developers METR studied thought that the AI coding tools had made them work more efficiently, even though the tools had actually slowed them down substantially.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Optimizing infrastructure</strong></h3><p>Writing code quickly isn‚Äôt that much of an advantage if you have to wait hours, days, or weeks for it to run. LLM training, in particular, is an agonizingly slow process, and the most sophisticated reasoning models can take many minutes to generate a single response. These delays are major bottlenecks for AI development, says Azalia Mirhoseini, an assistant professor of computer science at Stanford University and senior staff scientist at Google DeepMind. ‚ÄúIf we can run AI faster, we can innovate more,‚Äù she says.</p><p>That‚Äôs why Mirhoseini has been using AI to optimize AI chips. Back in 2021, she and her collaborators at Google built a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w">non-LLM AI system</a> that could decide where to place various components on a computer chip to optimize efficiency. Although some other researchers <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.11014">failed to replicate</a> the study‚Äôs results, Mirhoseini says that <em>Nature </em>investigated the paper and upheld the work‚Äôs validity‚Äîand she notes that Google has used the system‚Äôs designs for multiple generations of its custom AI chips.</p><p>More recently, Mirhoseini has applied LLMs to the problem of writing kernels, low-level functions that control how various operations, like matrix multiplication, are carried out in chips. She‚Äôs found that even general-purpose LLMs can, in some cases, write kernels that <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2025/05/28/fast-kernels.html">run faster</a> than the human-designed versions.</p><p>Elsewhere at Google, scientists built a system that they used to optimize various parts of the company‚Äôs LLM infrastructure. The system, called <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/14/1116438/google-deepminds-new-ai-uses-large-language-models-to-crack-real-world-problems/">AlphaEvolve</a>, prompts Google‚Äôs Gemini LLM to write algorithms for solving some problem, evaluates those algorithms, and asks Gemini to improve on the most successful‚Äîand repeats that process several times. AlphaEvolve designed a new approach for running datacenters that saved 0.7% of Google‚Äôs computational resources, made further improvements to Google‚Äôs custom chip design, and designed a new kernel that sped up Gemini‚Äôs training by 1%.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That might sound like a small improvement, but at a huge company like Google it equates to enormous savings of time, money, and energy. And Matej Balog, a staff research scientist at Google DeepMind who led the AlphaEvolve project, says that he and his team tested the system on only a small component of Gemini‚Äôs overall training pipeline. Applying it more broadly, he says, could lead to more savings.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Automating training</strong></h3><p>LLMs are famously data hungry, and training them is costly at every stage. In some specific domains‚Äîunusual programming languages, for example‚Äîreal-world data is too scarce to train LLMs effectively. Reinforcement learning with human feedback, a technique in which humans score LLM responses to prompts and the LLMs are then trained using those scores, has been key to creating models that behave in line with human standards and preferences, but obtaining human feedback is slow and expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>Increasingly, LLMs are being used to fill in the gaps. If prompted with plenty of examples, LLMs can generate plausible synthetic data in domains in which they haven‚Äôt been trained, and that synthetic data can then be used for training. LLMs can also be used effectively for reinforcement learning: In an approach called ‚ÄúLLM as a judge,‚Äù LLMs, rather than humans, are used to score the outputs of models that are being trained. That approach is key to the influential ‚ÄúConstitutional AI‚Äù framework proposed by Anthropic researchers in 2022, in which one LLM is trained to be less harmful based on feedback from another LLM.</p><p>Data scarcity is a particularly acute problem for AI agents. Effective agents need to be able to carry out multistep plans to accomplish particular tasks, but examples of successful step-by-step task completion are scarce online, and using humans to generate new examples would be pricey. To overcome this limitation, Stanford‚Äôs Mirhoseini and her colleagues have recently piloted a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04736">technique</a> in which an LLM agent generates a possible step-by-step approach to a given problem, an LLM judge evaluates whether each step is valid, and then a new LLM agent is trained on those steps. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not limited by data anymore, because the model can just arbitrarily generate more and more experiences,‚Äù Mirhoseini says.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Perfecting agent design</strong></h3><p>One area where LLMs haven‚Äôt yet made major contributions is in the design of LLMs themselves. Today‚Äôs LLMs are all based on a neural-network structure called a transformer, which was proposed by human researchers in 2017, and the notable improvements that have since been made to the architecture were also human-designed.&nbsp;</p><p>But the rise of LLM agents has created an entirely new design universe to explore. Agents need tools to interact with the outside world and instructions for how to use them, and optimizing those tools and instructions is essential to producing effective agents. ‚ÄúHumans haven‚Äôt spent as much time mapping out all these ideas, so there‚Äôs a lot more low-hanging fruit,‚Äù Clune says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to just create an AI system to go pick it.‚Äù</p><p>Together with researchers at the startup Sakana AI, Clune created a system called a ‚Äú<a href="https://sakana.ai/dgm/">Darwin G√∂del Machine</a>‚Äù: an LLM agent that can iteratively modify its prompts, tools, and other aspects of its code to improve its own task performance. Not only did the Darwin G√∂del Machine achieve higher task scores through modifying itself, but as it evolved, it also managed to find new modifications that its original version wouldn‚Äôt have been able to discover. It had entered a true self-improvement loop.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Advancing research</strong></h3><p>Although LLMs are speeding up numerous parts of the LLM development pipeline, humans may still remain essential to AI research for quite a while. Many experts point to ‚Äúresearch taste,‚Äù or the ability that the best scientists have to pick out promising new research questions and directions, as both a particular challenge for AI and a key ingredient in AI development.&nbsp;</p><p>But Clune says research taste might not be as much of a challenge for AI as some researchers think. He and Sakana AI researchers are working on an end-to-end system for AI research that they call the ‚Äú<a href="https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/">AI Scientist</a>.‚Äù It searches through the scientific literature to determine its own research question, runs experiments to answer that question, and then writes up its results.</p><p>One paper that it wrote earlier this year, in which it devised and tested a new training strategy aimed at making neural networks better at combining examples from their training data, was anonymously submitted to a workshop at the International Conference on Machine Learning, or ICML‚Äîone of the most prestigious conferences in the field‚Äîwith the consent of the workshop organizers. The training strategy didn‚Äôt end up working, but the paper was scored highly enough by reviewers to qualify it for acceptance (it is worth noting that ICML workshops have lower standards for acceptance than the main conference). In another instance, Clune says, the AI Scientist came up with a research idea that was later independently proposed by a human researcher on X, where it attracted plenty of interest from other scientists.</p><p>‚ÄúWe are looking right now at the GPT-1 moment of the AI Scientist,‚Äù Clune says. ‚ÄúIn a few short years, it is going to be writing papers that will be accepted at the top peer-reviewed conferences and journals in the world. It will be making novel scientific discoveries.‚Äù</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is superintelligence on its way?</strong></h3><p>With all this enthusiasm for AI self-improvement, it seems likely that in the coming months and years, the contributions AI makes to its own development will only multiply. To hear Mark Zuckerberg tell it, this could mean that superintelligent models, which exceed human capabilities in many domains, are just around the corner. In reality, though, the impact of self-improving AI is far from certain.</p><p>It‚Äôs notable that AlphaEvolve has sped up the training of its own core LLM system, Gemini‚Äîbut that 1% speedup may not observably change the pace of Google‚Äôs AI advancements. ‚ÄúThis is still a feedback loop that‚Äôs very slow,‚Äù says Balog, the AlphaEvolve researcher. ‚ÄúThe training of Gemini takes a significant amount of time. So you can maybe see the exciting beginnings of this virtuous [cycle], but it‚Äôs still a very slow process.‚Äù</p><p>If each subsequent version of Gemini speeds up its own training by an additional 1%, those accelerations will compound. And because each successive generation will be more capable than the previous one, it should be able to achieve even greater training speedups‚Äînot to mention all the other ways it might devise to improve itself. Under such circumstances, proponents of superintelligence argue, an eventual intelligence explosion looks inevitable.</p><p>This conclusion, however, ignores a key observation: Innovation gets harder over time. In the early days of any scientific field, discoveries come fast and easy. There are plenty of obvious experiments to run and ideas to investigate, and none of them have been tried before. But as the science of deep learning matures, finding each additional improvement might require substantially more effort on the part of both humans and their AI collaborators. It‚Äôs possible that by the time AI systems attain human-level research abilities, humans or less-intelligent AI systems will already have plucked all the low-hanging fruit.</p><p>Determining the real-world impact of AI self-improvement, then, is a mighty challenge. To make matters worse, the AI systems that matter most for AI development‚Äîthose being used inside frontier AI companies‚Äîare likely more advanced than those that have been released to the general public, so measuring o3‚Äôs capabilities might not be a great way to infer what‚Äôs happening inside OpenAI.</p><p>But external researchers are doing their best‚Äîby, for example, tracking the overall pace of AI development to determine whether or not that pace is accelerating. METR is monitoring advancements in AI abilities by measuring how long it takes humans to do tasks that cutting-edge systems can complete themselves. They‚Äôve found that the length of tasks that AI systems can complete independently has, since the release of GPT-2 in 2019, <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/">doubled every seven months.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Since 2024, that doubling time has shortened to four months, which suggests that AI progress is indeed accelerating. There may be unglamorous reasons for that: Frontier AI labs are flush with investor cash, which they can spend on hiring new researchers and purchasing new hardware. But it‚Äôs entirely plausible that AI self-improvement could also be playing a role.</p><p>That‚Äôs just one indirect piece of evidence. But Davidson, the Forethought researcher, says there‚Äôs good reason to expect that AI will supercharge its own advancement, at least for a time. METR‚Äôs work suggests that the low-hanging-fruit effect isn‚Äôt slowing down human researchers today, or at least that increased investment is effectively counterbalancing any slowdown. If AI notably increases the productivity of those researchers, or even takes on some fraction of the research work itself, that balance will shift in favor of research acceleration.</p><p>‚ÄúYou would, I think, strongly expect that there‚Äôll be a period when AI progress speeds up,‚Äù Davidson says. ‚ÄúThe big question is how long it goes on for.‚Äù</p>

				<![CDATA[
<p>OpenAI has finally released its <a href="https://openai.com/open-models/">first open-weight large language models</a> since 2019‚Äôs GPT-2. These new ‚Äúgpt-oss‚Äù models are available in two different sizes and score similarly to the company‚Äôs o3-mini and o4-mini models on several benchmarks. Unlike the models available through OpenAI‚Äôs web interface, these new open models can be freely downloaded, run, and even modified on laptops and other local devices.</p><p>In the company‚Äôs many years without an open LLM release, some users have taken to referring to it with the pejorative ‚ÄúClosedAI.‚Äù That sense of frustration had escalated in the past few months as these long-awaited models were delayed twice‚Äîfirst in June and then in July. With their release, however, OpenAI is reestablishing itself as a presence for users of open models.</p><p>That‚Äôs particularly notable at a time when Meta, which had previously dominated the American open-model landscape with its Llama models, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/14/technology/meta-superintelligence-lab-ai.html">may be reorienting toward closed releases</a>‚Äîand when Chinese open models, such as DeepSeek‚Äôs offerings, Kimi K2, and Alibaba‚Äôs Qwen series, are becoming more popular than their American competitors.</p><p>‚ÄúThe vast majority of our [enterprise and startup] customers are already using a lot of open models,‚Äù said Casey Dvorak, a research program manager at OpenAI, in a media briefing about the model release. ‚ÄúBecause there is no [competitive] open model from OpenAI, we wanted to plug that gap and actually allow them to use our technology across the board.‚Äù</p><p>The new models come in two different sizes, the smaller of which can theoretically run on 16 GB of RAM‚Äîthe minimum amount that Apple currently offers on its computers. The larger model requires a high-end laptop or specialized hardware.</p><p>Open models have a few key use cases. Some organizations may want to customize models for their own purposes or save money by running models on their own equipment, though that equipment comes at a substantial upfront cost. Others‚Äîsuch hospitals, law firms, and governments‚Äîmight need models that they can run locally for data security reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI has facilitated such activity by releasing its open models under a permissive Apache 2.0 license, which allows the models to be used for commercial purposes. Nathan Lambert, post-training lead at the Allen Institute for AI, says that this choice is commendable: Such licenses are typical for Chinese open-model releases, but Meta released its Llama models under a bespoke, more restrictive license. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very good thing for the open community,‚Äù he says.</p><p>Researchers who study how LLMs work also need open models, so that they can examine and manipulate those models in detail. ‚ÄúIn part, this is about reasserting OpenAI‚Äôs dominance in the research ecosystem,‚Äù says Peter Henderson, an assistant professor at Princeton University who has worked extensively with open models. If researchers do adopt gpt-oss as new workhorses, OpenAI could see some concrete benefits, Henderson says‚Äîit might adopt innovations discovered by other researchers into its own model ecosystem.</p><p>More broadly, Lambert says, releasing an open model now could help OpenAI reestablish its status in an increasingly crowded AI environment. ‚ÄúIt kind of goes back to years ago, where they were seen as <em>the</em> AI company,‚Äù he says. Users who want to use open models will now have the option to meet all their needs with OpenAI products, rather than turning to Meta‚Äôs Llama or Alibaba‚Äôs Qwen when they need to run something locally.</p><p>The rise of Chinese open models like Qwen over the past year may have been a particularly salient factor in OpenAI‚Äôs calculus. An employee from OpenAI emphasized at the media briefing that the company doesn‚Äôt see these open models as a response to actions taken by any other AI company, but OpenAI is clearly attuned to the geopolitical implications of China‚Äôs open-model dominance. ‚ÄúBroad access to these capable‚Ä¨‚Ä≠ open-weights models created in the US helps expand democratic AI rails,‚Äù the company wrote in a <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/">blog post</a> announcing the models‚Äô release.&nbsp;</p><p>Since DeepSeek exploded onto the AI scene at the start of 2025, observers have noted that Chinese models often <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/28/we-tried-out-deepseek-it-works-well-until-we-asked-it-about-tiananmen-square-and-taiwan">refuse to speak about topics</a> that the Chinese Communist Party has deemed verboten, such as Tiananmen Square. Such observations‚Äîas well as longer-term risks, like the possibility that agentic models could purposefully write vulnerable code‚Äîhave made some AI experts concerned about the growing adoption of Chinese models. ‚ÄúOpen models are a form of soft power,‚Äù Henderson says.</p><p>Lambert released a <a href="https://www.atomproject.ai/">report</a> on Monday documenting how Chinese models are overtaking American offerings like Llama and advocating for a renewed commitment to domestic open models. Several prominent AI researchers and entrepreneurs, such as HuggingFace CEO Clement Delangue, Stanford‚Äôs Percy Liang, and former OpenAI researcher Miles Brundage, have signed on.</p><p>The Trump administration, too, has emphasized development of open models in its AI Action Plan. With both this model release and previous statements, OpenAI is aligning itself with that stance. ‚ÄúIn their filings about the action plan, [OpenAI] pretty clearly indicated that they see US‚ÄìChina as a key issue and want to position themselves as very important to the US system,‚Äù says Rishi Bommasani, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>And OpenAI may see concrete political advantages from aligning with the administration‚Äôs AI priorities, Lambert says. As the company continues to build out its extensive computational infrastructure, it will need political support and approvals, and sympathetic leadership could go a long way.</p><p></p>

Initial reviews for these agents have been mixed at best, though, because they struggle to interact with all the different components of our digital lives.</p><p>Anthropic and Google are among the companies and groups working to fix that. Over the past year, they have both introduced protocols that try to define how AI agents should interact with each other and the world around them. If they work as planned, they could give us a crucial part of the infrastructure we need for agents to be useful.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technologyreview.com%2F2025%2F08%2F04%2F1120996%2Fprotocols-help-agents-navigate-lives-mcp-a2a%3Futm_source%3Dthe_download%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dthe_download.unpaid.engagement%26utm_term%3D%253C%253C%2520Test%2520Class%2520%253E%253E%26utm_content%3D08-05-2025%26mc_cid%3D3323087a2e%26mc_eid%3DUNIQID&amp;data=05%7C02%7C%7Cd50d75ca29ac484eeaa908ddd41266c5%7C961f23f8614c4756bafff1997766a273%7C1%7C0%7C638899897723418290%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=7zIbrKqL00ODCx8o58palZOrIciU3b%2Fhc42i3LJxE%2Bg%3D&amp;reserved=0">Read our&nbsp;story to learn more</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>‚ÄîPeter Hall</em></p><p></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A glimpse into OpenAI‚Äôs largest ambitions</strong></h3><p><em>‚ÄîJames O‚ÄôDonnell</em></p><p>OpenAI has given itself a dual mandate: on the one hand, it‚Äôs a tech giant rooted in products, including of course ChatGPT, which people around the world reportedly send 2.5 billion messages to each day.

<p>OpenAI has given itself a dual mandate. On the one hand, it‚Äôs a tech giant rooted in products, including of course ChatGPT, which people around the world reportedly send 2.5 billion requests to each day. But its original mission is to serve as a research lab that will not only create ‚Äú<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/11/1112983/agi-is-suddenly-a-dinner-table-topic/">artificial general intelligence</a>‚Äù but ensure that it benefits all of humanity.&nbsp;</p><p>My colleague Will Douglas Heaven recently sat down for an exclusive conversation with the two figures at OpenAI most responsible for pursuing the latter ambitions: chief research officer Mark Chen and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki. If you haven‚Äôt already, you must read his piece.</p><p>It provides a rare glimpse into how the company thinks beyond marginal improvements to chatbots and contemplates the biggest unknowns in AI: whether it could someday reason like a human, whether it <em>should</em>, and how tech companies conceptualize the societal implications.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/31/1120885/the-two-people-shaping-the-future-of-openais-research/">whole story is worth reading</a> for all it reveals‚Äîabout how OpenAI thinks about the safety of its products, what AGI actually means, and more‚Äîbut here‚Äôs one thing that stood out to me.&nbsp;</p><p>As Will points out, there were two recent wins for OpenAI in its efforts to build AI that outcompetes humans. Its models took second place at a top-level coding competition and‚Äîalongside those from Google DeepMind‚Äîachieved gold-medal-level results in the 2025 International Math Olympiad.</p><p>People who believe that AI doesn‚Äôt pose genuine competition to human-level intelligence might actually take some comfort in that. AI is good at the mathematical and analytical, which are on full display in <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/04/1117753/whats-next-for-ai-and-math/">olympiads</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/01/20/1110180/the-second-wave-of-ai-coding-is-here/">coding</a> competitions. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs any good at grappling with the messiness of human emotions, making hard decisions, or creating art that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/16/1114433/ai-artificial-intelligence-music-diffusion-creativity-songs-writer/">resonates with anyone</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But that distinction‚Äîbetween machine-like reasoning and the ability to think creatively‚Äîis not one OpenAI‚Äôs heads of research are inclined to make.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about programming and math here,‚Äù said Pachocki. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs really about creativity, coming up with novel ideas, connecting ideas from different places.‚Äù</p><p>That‚Äôs why, the researchers say, these testing grounds for AI will produce models that have an increasing ability to reason like a person, one of the most important goals OpenAI is working toward. Reasoning models break problems down into more discrete steps, but even the best have limited ability to chain pieces of information together and approach problems logically.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI is throwing a massive amount of money and talent at that problem not because its researchers think it will result in higher scores at math contests, but because they believe it will allow their AI models to come closer to human intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>As Will recalls in the piece, he said he thought maybe it‚Äôs fine for AI to excel at math and coding, but the idea of having an AI acquire people skills and replace politicians is perhaps not. Chen pulled a face and looked up at the ceiling: ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù</p><p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/31/1120885/the-two-people-shaping-the-future-of-openais-research/">Read the full story from Will Douglas Heaven</a>.</p><p><em>This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

<p>A growing number of companies are launching AI agents that can do things on your behalf‚Äîactions like sending an email, making a document, or editing a database. Initial reviews for these agents have been mixed at best, though, because they struggle to interact with all the different components of our digital lives.</p><p>Part of the problem is that we are still building the necessary infrastructure to help agents navigate the world. If we want agents to complete tasks for us, we need to give them the necessary tools while also making sure they use that power responsibly.</p><p>Anthropic and Google are among the companies and groups working on exactly that. Over the past year, they have both introduced protocols that try to define how AI agents should interact with each other and the world around them. These protocols could make it easier for agents to control other programs like email clients and note-taking apps.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason has to do with application programming interfaces, the connections between computers or programs that govern much of our online world. APIs currently reply to ‚Äúpings‚Äù with standardized information. But AI models aren‚Äôt made to work exactly the same every time. The very randomness that helps them come across as conversational and expressive also makes it difficult for them to both call an API and understand the response.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúModels speak a natural language,‚Äù says Theo Chu, a project manager at Anthropic. ‚ÄúFor [a model] to get context and do something with that context, there is a translation layer that has to happen for it to make sense to the model.‚Äù Chu works on one such translation technique, the Model Context Protocol (<a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro">MCP</a>), which Anthropic introduced at the end of last year.&nbsp;</p><p>MCP attempts to standardize how AI agents interact with the world via various programs, and it‚Äôs already very popular. One web <a href="https://mcp.so/servers?tag=latest">aggregator</a> for MCP servers (essentially, the portals for different programs or tools that agents can access) lists over 15,000 servers already.&nbsp;</p><p>Working out how to govern how AI agents interact with each other is arguably an even steeper challenge, and it‚Äôs one the Agent2Agent protocol (<a href="https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/">A2A</a>), introduced by Google in April, tries to take on. Whereas MCP translates requests between words and code, A2A tries to moderate exchanges between agents, which is an ‚Äúessential next step for the industry to move beyond single-purpose agents,‚Äù Rao Surapaneni, who works with A2A at Google Cloud, wrote in an email to <em>MIT Technology Review</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/partners/">Google says</a> 150 companies have already partnered with it to develop and adopt A2A, including Adobe and Salesforce. At a high level, both MCP and A2A tell an AI agent what it absolutely needs to do, what it should do, and what it should not do to ensure a safe interaction with other services. In a way, they are complementary‚Äîeach agent in an A2A interaction could individually be using MCP to fetch information the other asks for.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Chu stresses that it is ‚Äúdefinitely still early days‚Äù for MCP, and the A2A <a href="https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/roadmap/">road map</a> lists plenty of tasks still to be done. We‚Äôve identified the three main areas of growth for MCP, A2A, and other agent protocols: security, openness, and efficiency.</p><p></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">What should these protocols say about security?</h3><p>Researchers and developers still don‚Äôt really understand how AI models work, and new vulnerabilities are being discovered all the time. For chatbot-style AI applications, malicious attacks can cause models to do all sorts of bad things, including regurgitating training data and spouting slurs. But for AI agents, which interact with the world on someone‚Äôs behalf, the possibilities are far riskier.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, one AI agent, made to read and send emails for someone, has already been <a href="https://labs.snyk.io/resources/agent-hijacking/">shown</a> to be vulnerable to what‚Äôs known as an indirect prompt injection attack. Essentially, an email could be written in a way that <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/01/technical-blog-strengthening-ai-agent-hijacking-evaluations">hijacks</a> the AI model and causes it to malfunction. Then, if that agent has access to the user‚Äôs files, it could be instructed to send private documents to the attacker.&nbsp;</p><p>Some researchers believe that protocols like MCP should prevent agents from carrying out harmful actions like this. However, it does not at the moment. ‚ÄúBasically, it does not have any security design,‚Äù says Zhaorun Chen, a&nbsp; University of Chicago PhD student who works on AI agent security and uses MCP servers.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce Schneier, a security researcher and activist, is skeptical that protocols like MCP will be able to do much to reduce the inherent risks that come with AI and is concerned that giving such technology more power will just give it more ability to cause harm in the real, physical world. ‚ÄúWe just don‚Äôt have good answers on how to secure this stuff,‚Äù says Schneier. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a security cesspool really fast.‚Äù&nbsp;</p><p>Others are more hopeful. Security design could be added to MCP and A2A similar to the way it is for internet protocols like HTTPS (though the nature of attacks on AI systems is very different). And Chen and Anthropic believe that standardizing protocols like MCP and A2A can help make it easier to catch and resolve security issues even as is. Chen uses MCP in his research to test the roles different programs can play in attacks to better understand vulnerabilities. Chu at Anthropic believes that these tools could let cybersecurity companies more easily deal with attacks against agents, because it will be easier to unpack who sent what.&nbsp;</p><p></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">How open should these protocols be?</h3><p>Although MCP and A2A are two of the most popular agent protocols available today, there are plenty of others in the works. Large companies like <a href="https://spec.acp.agntcy.org/">Cisco</a> and <a href="https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/introduction/welcome">IBM</a> are working on their own protocols, and other groups have put forth different designs like <a href="https://agoraprotocol.org/">Agora</a>, designed by researchers at the University of Oxford, which upgrades an agent-service communication from human language to structured data in real time.</p><p>Many developers hope there could eventually be a registry of safe, trusted systems to navigate the proliferation of agents and tools. Others, including Chen, want users to be able to rate different services in something like a Yelp for AI agent tools. Some more niche protocols have even built blockchains on top of MCP and A2A so that servers can show they are not just spam.&nbsp;</p><p>Both MCP and A2A are open-source, which is common for would-be standards as it lets others work on building them. This can help protocols develop faster and more transparently.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúIf we go build something together, we spend less time overall, because we‚Äôre not having to each reinvent the wheel,‚Äù says David Nalley, who leads developer experience at Amazon Web Services and works with a lot of open-source systems, including A2A and MCP.&nbsp;</p><p>Google donated A2A to the Linux Foundation, a nonprofit organization that guides open-source projects, back in June, and Amazon Web Services is now one of the collaborators on the project. With the foundation‚Äôs stewardship, the developers who work on A2A (including employees at Google and many others) all get a say in how it should evolve. MCP, on the other hand, is owned by Anthropic and licensed for free. That is a sticking point for some open-source advocates, who want others to have a say in how the code base itself is developed.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs admittedly some increased risk around a single person or a single entity being in absolute control,‚Äù says Nalley. He says most people would prefer multiple groups to have a ‚Äúseat at the table‚Äù to make sure that these protocols are serving everyone‚Äôs best interests.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Nalley does believe Anthropic is acting in good faith‚Äîits license, he says, is incredibly permissive, allowing other groups to create their own modified versions of the code (a process known as ‚Äúforking‚Äù).&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúSomeone could fork it if they needed to, if something went completely off the rails,‚Äù says Nalley. IBM‚Äôs <a href="https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/introduction/welcome">Agent Communication Protocol</a> was actually spun off of MCP.&nbsp;</p><p>Anthropic is still deciding exactly how to develop MCP. For now, it works with a steering committee of outside companies that help make decisions on MCP‚Äôs development, but Anthropic seems open to changing this approach. ‚ÄúWe are looking to evolve how we think about both ownership and governance in the future,‚Äù says Chu.</p><p></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Is natural language fast enough?</h3><p>MCP and A2A work on the agents‚Äô terms‚Äîthey use words and phrases (termed natural language in AI), just as AI models do when they are responding to a person. This is part of the selling point for these protocols, because it means the model doesn‚Äôt have to be trained to talk in a way that is unnatural to it. ‚ÄúAllowing a natural-language interface to be used between agents and not just with humans unlocks sharing the intelligence that is built into these agents,‚Äù says Surapaneni.</p><p>But this choice does come with drawbacks. Natural-language interfaces lack the precision of APIs, and that could result in incorrect responses. And it creates inefficiencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, an AI model reads and responds to text by splitting words into tokens. The AI model will read a prompt, split it into input tokens, generate a response in the form of output tokens, and then put these tokens into words to send back. These tokens define in some sense how much work the AI model has to do‚Äîthat‚Äôs why most AI platforms charge users according to the number of tokens used.&nbsp;</p><div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"><p>But the whole point of working in tokens is so that people can understand the output‚Äîit‚Äôs usually faster and more efficient for machine-to-machine communication to just work over code. MCP and A2A both work in natural language, so they require the model to spend tokens as the agent talks to other machines, like tools and other agents. The user never even sees these exchanges‚Äîall the effort of making everything human-readable doesn‚Äôt ever get read by a human. ‚ÄúYou waste a lot of tokens if you want to use MCP,‚Äù says Chen.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Chen describes this process as potentially very costly. For example, suppose the user wants the agent to read a document and summarize it. If the agent uses another program to summarize here, it needs to read the document, write the document to the program, read back the summary, and write it back to the user. Since the agent needed to read and write everything, both the document and the summary get doubled up. According to Chen, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually a lot of tokens.‚Äù</p><p>As with so many aspects of MCP and A2A‚Äôs designs, their benefits also create new challenges. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a long way to go if we want to scale up and actually make them useful,‚Äù says Chen.</p><p></p><p><em>Correction: This story was updated to clarify Nalley‚Äôs involvement with A2A. ¬†</em></p>
