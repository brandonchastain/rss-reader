I want to go through his argument then talk more generally about why this sort of analysis is particularly noxious.</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with a key thrust of Yglesias&#8217; essay: </p><h2><strong>Uber's success should be celebrated.</strong></h2><p>The company's "clever arbitrage around municipal taxi regulations" broke Big Taxi, a series of taxi cartels which relied on business models that prioritized inefficiency and anti-competitiveness. Uber has improved prices, led to great social outcomes (e.g. reducing drunk driving and racial discrimination in pickups), and at minimal cost (namely traffic congestion). </p><p>Yglesias starts with an article that American University law professor Hilary Allen wrote for the Law and Political Economy blog titled <a href="https://lpeproject.org/blog/why-we-need-to-stop-subsidizing-venture-capitalists/">&#8220;Why We Need to Stop Subsidizing Venture Capitalists&#8221;</a> where she opens:</p><blockquote><p>For many readers of this blog, Uber represents a cautionary tale. While the company attributed its initial success to cutting-edge technology&#8212;such as dynamic pricing, matching algorithms, real-time data&#8212;subsequent analysis has demonstrated that its growth was largely driven by <a href="https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3559&amp;context=faculty_scholarship">ignoring</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jul/10/uber-files-leak-reveals-global-lobbying-campaign">breaking</a>, and then <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/disrupting-regulation-regulating-disruption-the-politics-of-uber-in-the-united-states/B7691A244DDF05EF1AE23FE82326FC04">bending</a> taxi regulations to suit its business model.</p><p>For companies in the fintech sector, however, Uber&#8217;s approach represented a blueprint to follow. From lending to payments to stock trading to crypto, prominent fintech businesses have found a competitive edge not in technology itself, but in using narratives about technology as a smokescreen for the profitable arbitrage of financial regulations. This modus operandi is encouraged by Silicon Valley&#8217;s venture capitalists, who decide which businesses to fund and often provide advice, gin up hype, and lobby for the businesses they&#8217;ve chosen. Our society continues to shower VCs with public subsidies, but as I argue in this brief post, if regulatory arbitrage is what we&#8217;re getting from Silicon Valley&#8217;s VCs in exchange, it&#8217;s well past time to reconsider this relationship.</p></blockquote><p>Yglesias only quotes the first paragraph (more on that later) but responds to it with: </p><blockquote><p>What I want to talk about here is not Allen&#8217;s forward-looking argument, which focuses largely on fintech issues. But the breezy way in which she asserts that Uber is a &#8220;cautionary tale&#8221; and assumes her audience will agree without argumentation. She thinks the fact that Uber busted up the old regulatory system and got a whole new category of companies legalized is a dangerous precedent. I think it&#8217;s good! </p></blockquote><p>Yglesias sees Allen&#8217;s argument as "breezy" and in turn breezes by it, but it's worth spending some time actually engaging with Allen's argument to actually flesh out why we might have problems with Uber.</p><p>Allen's essay argues that VC-backed firms use an innovation "bait-and-switch" where they develop a business model built on a specific technology, craft a narrative about its ability to "democratize" and "disrupt" a legitimate issue, circumvent laws that get in the way of that business making a profit, and eventually convincing "lawmakers and regulators to change the law so that you never have to comply with it and those who are harmed have no recourse."</p><p>Allen hones in on fintech firms because they've been used this model to circumvent laws that protected consumers, investors, deposits, retirement funds, and the like from being gambled away on volatile assets or speculative activities that are incredibly risky for all but the businesses making these bets. </p><blockquote><p>Financial regulations were adopted over time to protect consumers from harm, protect our economy from debilitating financial crises, and further law enforcement and national security objectives. All this regulatory arbitrage is profitable for the fintech industry and the VCs who fund it, but it leaves most of us worse off. In addition to exposing the public to harm, fintech has <a href="https://southerncalifornialawreview.com/2025/07/05/fintech-and-techno-solutionism/">rarely delivered</a> on its promises to improve financial inclusion, or to make the financial system more efficient, competitive, or secure. Not content to keep skirting regulations, many fintech businesses and their VC backers have <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/17/nx-s1-5451413/crypto-week-stablecoin-genius-act-trump">successfully lobbied</a> regulators and Congress to change rules and laws to permanently accommodate and legitimize their business models. These efforts erode faith in our democratic process, and in the law&#8217;s ability to protect people from harm.</p></blockquote><p>To make matters worse, they are doing so with public funds. VC funds are limited partnerships that are only on the hook for what they invest, not what they lose. They successfully lobbied to gamble with pension funds, increasing appetite for risk by gambling with larger sums of other people's money. And they've secured tax loopholes that ensure fees and profits are taxed at substantially lower rates. </p><p>So what happens when a sector is constantly advancing business models that are subsidized by the public, aimed at rewriting laws to realize previously illegal levels of profit-making, and doing so with little regard for (to borrow a word from economics) &#8220;negative externalities&#8221;? </p><p>Allen writes:</p><blockquote><p>Leading VC firms are well-aware of the important role played by this special legal treatment. Lobbying, media blitzes, and hiring government officials for access are all part of the VC industry&#8217;s standard operating procedure, but the playbook has been deployed with particular zeal when it comes to crypto. The crypto industry was responsible for <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/big-crypto-big-spending-2024/">44% of </a><em><a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/big-crypto-big-spending-2024/">all </a></em><a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/big-crypto-big-spending-2024/">corporate expenditures</a> during the 2024 election cycle&#8212;with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/technology/crypto-congress-financing-lobbying.html">most of it</a> coming from Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase, and another crypto company called Ripple. It&#8217;s worth bearing in mind that the public is not merely subsidizing a financial grift when it comes to crypto&#8212;it is subsidizing an <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/9781517901806/the-politics-of-bitcoin/">ideological project</a> with techno-libertarian goals of avoiding regulation, taxes, and eliminating central banks. Crypto is intended, for instance, to provide the infrastructure for the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382796473_The_Network_State_Venture_Capital_and_the_Political_Economy_of_Exit">Network State movement</a> backed by Andreessen Horowitz partner Marc Andreessen and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, which aims to create tech-CEO led dictatorships outside the boundaries of democratic governance.</p></blockquote><p>Yglesias dismisses Allen&#8217;s essay as being solely about fintech, but if he actually read it he would see it is about the consequences of letting predatory firms rewrite our laws to maximize their profits and to maximize their ability to convert those profits into political power that can further boost said profits. Should firms be able to subordinate the public interest to their business models or should it be the other way around? And is it any surprise that Yglesias is less interested in thinking through this question than in making a contrarian argument that affirms his priors?</p><p>Back to Uber. Yglesias' argument around Uber is relatively simple:</p><blockquote><p>The taxi industry as a whole is not that large or important in the grand scheme of things. But the dynamics around ride-hailing really do, I think, illustrate the core differences between economic analysis and the LPE worldview in which Uber serves as a cautionary tale.</p></blockquote><p>We will return to the idea that Yglesias&#8217; misunderstanding of Uber is &#8220;economic analysis&#8221; while LPE&#8217;s is anti-economics, but for now we&#8217;ll focus on the narrative he advances. Yglesias explains that the taxi market was highly fragmented and localized, suggesting LPE opposes Uber because of fidelity to small businesses as opposed to a commitment to "high output and good prices." Taxis extract fares from riders and distribute them to owners of taxi firms or medallions, taxis enjoy massive barriers to entry that inflated prices, and they incur massive deadweight loss (a lot of people who would take taxis don't because the prices are too high).</p><p>Uber's arbitrage, then, broke the rickety old system because Uber&#8217;s sleek tech collected extensive data on customers and drivers that allowed it to calibrate prices and wages which would increase trips and better compensate drivers. It gave drivers flexibility to set their own hours, increased utilization rates (drivers spent more time with a passenger in the car), reduced drunk driving, reduced racial discrimination, and only cost a little traffic congestion.</p><blockquote><p>The bad guys in this instance were not the richest people in America or huge corporations wielding concentrated power &#8212; they were a disaggregated network of largely anonymous small business owners. We have more competition now, but also a marketplace that&#8217;s dominated by a much smaller number of large global companies. And that&#8217;s good!</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>This all sounds good and well, but is it true?</strong></em></p><p>Back in 2017, economist Hubert Horan's "Will the Growth of Uber Increase Economic Welfare" article made the case that even a cursory look at Uber's actual economics revealed it to be a deeply parasitic enterprise:</p><blockquote><p>Uber has no ability&#8212;now or in the foreseeable future&#8212;to earn sustainable profits in a competitive marketplace. Uber's investors cannot earn returns on the $13 billion they have invested without achieving levels of market dominance that would allow them to exploit anti-competitive market power. The growth of Uber is entirely explained by massive predatory subsidies that have totally undermined the normal workings of both capital and labor markets. Capital has shifted from more productive to less productive uses, the price signals that allow drivers and customers to make welfare maximizing decisions have been deliberately distorted, and the laws and regulations that protect the public's interest in competition and efficient urban transport have been seriously undermined. Absolutely nothing in the "narrative" Uber has used to explain its growth is supported by objective, verifiable evidence of its actual competitive economics.</p></blockquote><p>To show Uber's growth enhanced welfare, it would need to demonstrate three things: (1) the ability to earn sustainable profits in competitive markets or demonstrate scale/network effects that could realize these profits; (2) the capacity to provide services "at significantly lower cost than existing competitors" or "produce service that consumers value much more highly at similar costs"; (3) significant competitive advantages based on its product, tech, or innovations that cannot be replicated.</p><p>Then and now, Uber fails each welfare enhancement test.</p><p>Uber has a long history of publishing incomplete, opaque, and adjusted financial reports that do not adhere to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) until relatively recent. Data that Horan cobbled together on its operations from 2012 to 2016 showed Uber&#8217;s rapid growth did not yield rapid margin improvements observed in other Silicon Valley startups it compared itself to in PR (Amazon, Facebook, etc.). What Horan observed is that when Uber&#8217;s margins improved was not because of efficiency or network effects, but because of driver pay cuts. </p><p>How have things looked since? A 2018 JP Morgan study <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/9/24/17884608/uber-driver-gig-economy-money-pay-lyft-postmates">found</a> that on-demand delivery and ride-hail workers made 53 percent less in 2017 than they did in 2013. A 2018 EPI study <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/uber-and-the-labor-market-uber-drivers-compensation-wages-and-the-scale-of-uber-and-the-gig-economy/">found</a> that a third of passenger fares went to Uber via fees, driver compensation averaged $11.77 after fees and expenses (lower than average private-sector worker hourly pay of $32.06 and lower than service workers, the least-paid major occupation with an average hourly pay of $14.99), $10.87 an hour after deducting mandatory Social Security/Medicare taxes that self-employed drivers must pay, and $9.21 an hour after deducting the cost of a "modest" benefits package equivalent to what a W-2 employee might have.</p><blockquote><p>The Uber driver W-2 equivalent hourly wage is roughly at the 10th percentile of all wage and salary workers&#8217; wages, meaning Uber drivers earn less than what 90 percent of workers earn. The Uber driver W-2 equivalent hourly wage falls below the mandated minimum wage in the majority of major Uber urban markets (13 of 20 major markets, which include 18 cities, a county, and a state). The Uber driver &#8220;no benefits&#8221; hourly wage or discretionary compensation&#8212;the hourly compensation adjusted for an assumption that Uber drivers pay the extra payroll taxes that the self-employed must pay but do not provide a standard benefits package for themselves&#8212;falls below the mandated minimum wage in nine of 20 major markets, including the three largest (Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York).</p></blockquote><p>Back then, it took an incredible amount of mental effort (or none at all in the case of some commentators) to ignore that that a key part of Uber&#8217;s arbitrage scheme was figuring out how to transfer more cash from labor to capital than was previously legally allowed&#8212;the cost of attempted margin improvements was externalized on drivers, whose working conditions degraded as they were paid out starvation wages. </p><p>In 2023, Columbia Business School professor Len Sherman <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lensherman/2023/01/16/ubers-new-math-increase-prices-and-squeeze-driver-pay/?sh=32b05b8fc8a2">affirmed</a> much of what Horan argued when he observed Uber's 72 percent annual revenue growth and profit margin improvements that year were driven by accounting shenanigans (<em><strong>&#8220;Uber has never disclosed sufficient data to allow a fully substantiated assessment of its operational and financial performance&#8221;</strong></em>) alongside the fact that "Uber has been raising US ridehail prices four times faster than the rate of inflation while squeezing driver pay" in pursuit of revenue growth and profits. Since 2018&#8212;as part of a bid to juice investor appetite for its 2019 IPO&#8212;Uber raised prices by the equivalent of <strong>18 percent per year</strong> while trips were down 29 percent from pre-pandemic Q319 to Q322 and fares were hiked 41 percent over the same period. </p><p>Sherman goes on to write that Uber has relatively few options for significantly growing its core revenue: improving productivity to generate more revenue per trip (batched delivery, pooled rides, etc.), new revenue sources (namely advertising), and increasing its take by hiking fares or delivery fees or cutting driver pay. Sherman makes it clear that Uber has prioritized the third plank of options:</p><blockquote><p>These are the actions that undoubtedly are driving Uber&#8217;s recent financial performance improvements and the clearest manifestations of Dara&#8217;s &#8220;new math&#8221; to grow revenues (passenger fares) faster than expenses (driver pay). The sketchy data Uber does disclose confirms that the company has been increasing its take rates over the past few years. As already noted, passenger fares have been trending significantly higher for the past five years. While driver comp data is harder to come by, Uber&#8217;s recent shift to &#8220;upfront prices&#8221; has effectively decoupled consumer prices and driver pay from actual travel time and distance, giving the company cover to increase the spread between consumer prices and driver pay.</p><p>And in this regard, Uber enjoys a massive competitive advantage: more data on consumer and driver behavior on a global scale than any other mobility or delivery provider. Armed with such market insight, Uber is in an ideal position to practice what <a href="https://archive.ph/o/pmn8f/https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/strategy/price-discrimination/">economists call</a> first-order price discrimination &#8212; that is, charging each customer prices based on their known willingness to pay and setting each driver&#8217;s pay based on their known willingness to serve. The resulting upside potential of such price discrimination is enormous, and the opportunity (massive data + AI algorithms + upfront pricing policies) and need (growing investor pressure for near-term profitability) to exploit it is urgent.</p><p>Uber has historically denied (without evidence, of course) that they in any way set prices or pay based on individual passenger or driver characteristics. However, their recent tactics <em>de facto</em> promote a race-to-the-bottom in driver pay by operating a bidding process on their driving app where competing drivers have literally seconds to accept low pay offers (usually after Uber&#8217;s initial low pay offer to a specific driver was rejected). Anecdotal evidence also suggests that Uber may be using similar tactics to set and revise passenger fares, lowering them only if a passenger rejects its initial higher price offer.</p></blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s skip ahead to the present. In 2025, Uber has now consistently reported quarterly profits since 2023. Uber&#8217;s second-quarter results on Wednesday: it beat revenue expectations, gross bookings were up 17 percent from last year, revenue up 18 percent since last year, monthly riders are up' posted a $1 billion quarterly profit, and so on and so on. It might be instructive to look at the past few years of improvements that led us here, so let&#8217;s rewind and look at Uber&#8217;s P&amp;L improvement from 2019 to 2024. Here, again, I&#8217;ll refer to Horan who poured over the books to try and piece together a more complete picture of Uber&#8217;s finances since, as Horan and Sherman lay out, Uber regularly omits, obscures, or otherwise obfuscates what is offered.</p><p>In 2024, Horan looked at Uber's full year financial reports&#8212;it's a notable year because after losing $33 billion for its first 13 years, the company seemed to have finally turned a corner. Horan spends the first chunk of the piece explaining that a significant part of Uber's operating results trace back to dubious practices such as "its estimate of the changes of value in untraceable securities it received after shutting down operations that had been hopelessly unprofitable" such as shares in firms that beat Uber worldwide (Didi, Yandex, Grab) or in firms that acquired its failed moonshot projects (Aurora's acquisition of Uber's failed autonomous vehicle unit). </p><p>Horan estimates 2023 and 2024 "net profitability" were each inflated by $1.8 billion due to the aforementioned practices. He also finds that $6.4 billion of Uber's 4Q24 bottom line came from a tax valuation release, thanks to the massive losses it incurred for years (it has claimed over $41 billion in deffered tax assets). These add up and overstated Uber's P&amp;L by 18 points in 2024, made "net profitability" a useless metric, but still allowed the firm to claim profit margins substantially higher than reality. To make matters worse, the firm publishes deceptively simplistic metrics that shed light any real changes in the way its services are consumed, their unit economics, differences across locales, or anything detailed enough to invite scrutiny. Operational costs are similarly blended and not broken out at the level of detail needed to clearly figure out Uber's take or driver revenue, driver incentives and bonuses, and so on.</p><p>These practices persist to this day and there&#8217;s little reason for Uber to change them as investors and reporters continue to report out Uber&#8217;s invented metrics, accept its garbled P&amp;L data, and parrot back the talking points about its sustainability and viability and value that are built atop the distorted results.</p><p>After correcting Uber's numbers, however, Horan still found a massive improvement&#8212;$4 billion in 2022, then another $2 billion in 2023 and 2024. How?</p><blockquote><p>Three major factors appear to have driven these improvements: Uber has been keeping a larger share of each passenger dollar (and giving drivers less), it eliminated major corporate costs during the pandemic, and developed more sophisticated price discrimination tools allowing it to charge higher fares to customers more likely to accept them and to reduce compensation offers to the minimum they thought specific drivers would accept.</p></blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve talked extensively about Uber&#8217;s successful campaign to hike fares while cutting driver pay by taking a larger cut of each trip. The second boils down to shifting more costs onto the driver by pulling back on marketing and subsidies (incentives and bonuses), instituting lockouts to reduce the number of drivers (especially in cities like NYC which instituted a minimum wage law tied to driver utilization rates), and slashing its corporate workforce. The third factor&#8212;sophisticated price discrimination tools&#8212;has proven to be especially lucrative and is key to bolstering how much can be gained with the first two.</p><p>University of California, Irvine School Law Professor Veena Dubal&#8217;s law review article <a href="https://columbialawreview.org/content/on-algorithmic-wage-discrimination/">&#8220;On Algorithmic Wage Discrimination&#8221;</a> extensively fleshes out how a firm like Uber can leverage their vast surveillance apparatuses, built out in the name of data-collection, and use them to squeeze their workers:</p><blockquote><p>As a labor management practice, algorithmic wage discrimination allows firms to personalize and differentiate wages for workers in ways unknown to them, paying them to behave in ways that the firm desires, perhaps for as little as the system determines that the workers may be willing to accept. Given the information asymmetry between workers and firms, companies can calculate the exact wage rates necessary to incentivize desired behaviors, while workers can only guess how firms determine their wages.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>[A]lgorithmic wage discrimination also creates a labor market in which people who are doing the same work, with the same skill, for the same company, at the same time may receive different hourly pay. Digitally personalized wages are often determined through obscure, complex systems that make it nearly impossible for workers to predict or understand their constantly changing, and frequently declining, compensation.</p></blockquote><p>Dubal&#8217;s article also features eight years of embedded ethnographic research centered on ride-hail drivers in California from 2014 to 2022. </p><blockquote><p>In defining algorithmic payment structures as unfair and unjust, workers frequently complained of their low hourly wages, even though they were not paid hourly. In describing the harms they suffered, they drew on the language of antidiscrimination law, condemning the variability of their income not just over time but more specifically compared to other drivers. The fact that different workers made different amounts for largely the same work was a source of grievance defined through inequities that often pitted workers against one another, leaving them to wonder what they were doing wrong or what others had figured out. This feature of algorithmic wage discrimination&#8212;because of its divisive effects&#8212;may also undermine workers&#8217; ability to organize collectively to raise their wages and improve their working conditions. </p><p>In addition to complaints about the unfairness of low, variable, and unpredictable hourly pay, workers made two other moral judgements about the techniques through which they were paid. First, as the techniques of algorithmic wage discrimination deployed by on-demand firms both lowered pay and became increasingly obscure, drivers described the process of attempting to earn not through the lens of gaming but through the lens of gambling. Second, they portrayed the algorithmic changes or interventions that prevented them from earning as they had hoped or expected as trickery or manipulation enacted by the firm. Vacillating between feeling possibility and impossibility, freedom and control, workers experienced algorithmic wage discrimination as a practice in which the machine boss&#8217;s structures and functions were designed to take advantage of them by providing the illusion of agency. As Dietrich, a part-time driver in Los Angeles said, &#8220;[It&#8217;s] constant cognitive dissonance. You&#8217;re free, but the app controls you. You&#8217;ve got it figured out, and then it all changes.&#8221;</p></blockquote><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">The Tech Bubble is a reader-supported publication.

If I could sum up everything we&#8217;ve covered and a few other key points for you, it would go as follows: </p><ul><li><p>Uber is an enterprise that regularly uses accounting tricks to obscure its failure to realize profits through innovation. It has taken advantage of <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3668606">superficial coverage in the business press</a> and crafted <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/">an aggressively deceptive PR campaign</a> built on <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2017/03/can-uber-ever-deliver-part-nine-1990s-koch-funded-propaganda-program-ubers-true-origin-story.html">older taxi deregulation lobbying playbooks</a> as well as <a href="https://www.promarket.org/2019/12/05/ubers-academic-research-program-how-to-use-famous-economists-to-spread-corporate-narratives/">company-sponsored academic research</a>.</p></li><li><p>Uber has realized stupendous growth by using capital as a weapon (investor subsidies), breaking the law then rewriting it (regulatory arbitrage), embracing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lensherman/2024/09/06/why-the-ftc-needs-to-investigate-ubers-anti-competitive-business-practices/">anti-competitive business practices</a>, and deploying incredibly successful political operations <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2024/05/09/inside-uber-political-machine/">in the United States</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jul/10/uber-files-leak-reveals-global-lobbying-campaign">worldwide</a> that have codified its arbitrage efforts.</p></li><li><p>Uber has realized profits largely through predatory behavior such as algorithmic wage discrimination and perpetual fare hikes. Expansions into other lines of business have benefited from its years of experimentation here (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-11/new-yorkers-see-58-rise-in-food-delivery-fees-as-apps-shift-costs-to-customers">namely food delivery</a>).</p></li><li><p>Uber has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/proposition-22s-victory-shows-how-uber-and-lyft-break-democracy/">offered a roadmap</a> for other firms interested in immiserating their workers, growing via the misallocation of public subsidies. The <a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/ubers-bastards">metastasis of the so-called &#8220;gig economy&#8221;</a> will continue unabated as <a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/ubers-bastards-ii">Uber&#8217;s bastards proliferate</a>.</p></li><li><p>It is <strong>bad</strong> when a firm uses investor subsidies to distort markets such that it can realize profits through predatory behavior, even worse when it does so with public subsidies, and even worse when this allows the firm to rewrite laws to realize profits locked behind activities made illegal because they are against the public interest, and creates a model for other firms to do so. That Yglesias cannot understand this suggests he is an idiot or operating in a different moral universe.</p></li></ul><p>It&#8217;s not clear why Yglesias looks at all of this and sees innovation. The previous system was not great, and we did not end up with a better system. Arguably it is worse, in part because it attracts commentators eager to defend it from criticism for no reason other than its use of technology. Is this what passes for &#8220;economic analysis?&#8221; </p><p>If you are so focused on innovation, how can you confuse it with plain old predation given a new digital skin? If you claim to be concerned with good outcomes, how can you overlook a business model that prizes its ability to sacrifice its workers, distort markets, break laws, and undermine democracy? </p>]]>

Climate change will be staved off only by accelerating the very developments bringing about the collapse of our ecological niche&#8212;so <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-impacts-data-centers-water-data/">consume the water</a>, <a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/07/elon-musk-memphis-pollution-colossus">foul the air</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/09/microsoft-ai-oil-contracts/679804/">enrich fossil fuel firms</a>, do whatever you must and do it with quick if there is going to be any hope of creating an <a href="https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/">&#8220;infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, infinitely helpful&#8221;</a> entity capable of saving the world. </p><p>Some believe that <strong>humanity will be liberated by subjecting vast swaths to undignified drudgery</strong>&#8212;we need ghost workers, potemkins, and sin-eaters to power the Great Work. The global AI value chain features critical processes&#8212;<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/Rani;%20Gobel;%20Dhir_Development%20of%20AI.pdf">data collection and annotation, analysis and model development, and data verification</a>&#8212;performed by "invisible workers" tucked away in digital sweatshops defined by piece-rate work, low pay, and undignified working conditions. As my TMK co-host Jathan Sadowski has made clear for years now, <a href="https://reallifemag.com/potemkin-ai/">Potemkin AI</a> (AKA &#8220;services that purport to be powered by sophisticated software, but actually rely on humans acting like robots&#8212;services that purport to be powered by sophisticated software, but actually rely on humans acting like robots&#8221;) can be best understood as <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-edited-volume/5319/chapter/3800165/Planetary-Potemkin-AI-The-Humans-Hidden-inside">a few things</a>, such as: </p><ul><li><p>Disciplinary power, or the power of "coaxing and cajoling, of implanting beliefs and inducing action&#8221; by, for example, convincing people you've built a panopticon that is "tirelessly processing feeds from the ubiquitous cameras, rather than groups of human analysts who take time, get fatigued, and make mistakes.."</p></li><li><p>Choosing &#8220;certain interests over others and reasserting the value of certain people over others&#8221; like prioritizing artificial intelligence infrastructure over human needs. Or, as Jathan writes, a "placeholder" for "attempts to use AI as a tool for replacing human decisions, exploiting human labor, and administering human life" so long as you don't look behind the curtain.</p></li></ul><p>On the question of sin-eaters, it is increasingly clear that firms will offer various configurations of man-machine systems to obfuscate culpability. A human will serve as a legal guarantor or as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/17/magazine/ai-new-jobs.html">"the final stop in the responsibility chain.&#8221;</a> AI will be used externalize moral agency, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/188313/artifical-intelligence-scams-propaganda-deceit">rationalizing solutionist approaches that preserve the status quo while doing nothing to address root causes</a> (e.g. robust carbon offset and credit markets that do not undermine fossil fuel extraction, content moderation that does not actually undermine hate speech, <a href="https://www.thecairoreview.com/essays/gaza-israels-ai-human-laboratory/">generated precision kill lists that justify genocide</a>, predictive (over)policing that justifies ongoing overpolicing, and so on.</p><p>In its bid to become a central AI platform, Meta will <a href="https://www.somo.nl/the-next-big-power-grab-in-ai-why-metas-scale-ai-deal-must-be-stopped/">spend $15 billion to acquire AI data labelling company Scale AI</a>&#8212;an acquisition that will bring together two firms with longstanding commitments to exploiting workers across the world that are central to their respective platforms. Scale sacrifices those workers in pursuit of outsized funding and valuations, access to a pig trough of military contracts, and now an acquisition by a much larger firm. Meta has, for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">a long while</a> now, <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2025-04-27/suicide-attempts-sackings-and-a-vow-of-silence-metas-new-moderators-face-worst-conditions-yet">sacrificed</a> its <a href="https://time.com/6147458/facebook-africa-content-moderation-employee-treatment/">workers</a> in pursuit of persistent growth that sustains its core surveillance advertising revenue stream while buying time to cultivate others (e.g. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zuckerberg-promises-a-pivotal-year-for-the-metaverse-as-its-reality-labs-division-continues-to-bleed-cash-233846764.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKcbGuHvqNG2ZlGpKzuRbIwiKhFHcvoZKE-iCSKcW36MEk7e6hxPKb_N_P5YJgSyu34BhvpDIOTjUC8ukhknElGc7IYXnKavWTbHyQlZkHR6qvAgJMcAcCTaU4WXmihwO4jE2h94CisDA5CvpQvIxRstjAZukvMtdOZNESHcLmCi">the metaverse</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/21/facebooks-plan-to-break-the-global-financial-system">its own financial system</a>, and AI tools for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/technology/meta-ai-military.html">federal agencies</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-ai-military-products-anduril/">military contractors</a>).</p><p>On that note, some believe the sacrifices will <strong>ensure a renewed Pax Americana</strong> that brings together the private tech sector and the armed forces to cultivate nationalist fervor at home alongside a strategy that steers global development towards our national interest. As an added benefit, deploying the next generation of weaponry at home will surveil and denaturalize and deport dissidents, terrorize and dispossess migrants, that introduce dysfunction to the body politic. </p><p>In a desperate bid to beat back China's ascent, <a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/brics-in-2025/">America is building a reactionary political coalition</a> that links fossil capital with tech oligarchs, warmongers with China hawks. The great white hope here is that China's predominance in various tech stacks can be beaten back to secure control over the future of our global energy system, the course of technological development and deployment, and what gets produced where/how/why across our planet. Why should the United States&#8212;or more precisely, why should this reactionary coalition&#8212;control <a href="https://www.disconnect.blog/p/why-should-the-us-decide-who-can">who gets access to various technologies</a>? Because we say so.</p><p>Some believe sacrifices will <strong>restore some semblance of a natural order we&#8217;ve lost sight of</strong>. The future of human flourishing, they insist, isn&#8217;t going to be found in the past few centuries of flirtations with democracy and liberalism, but in <a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/05/slobodian-neoliberalism-race-nationalism-hayek">a recommitment to Biological Hierarchies</a> that reimpose <a href="https://www.thenerdreich.com/we-can-call-bullshit-on-their-eugenic-futures/">caste, eugenics, apartheid, terror, and the like</a>. We must administer <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2025/02/15/speed-up-the-breakdown/">a harsh treatment for a harsher disease</a> that will cause a great deal of pain and misery in the short-term, but leave us better off in the long-run. That these reactionary ideologies are proving <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/jan/29/silicon-valley-rightwing-technofascism">increasingly fundamental</a> to the worldview of the most powerful people in the world and their sycophants, at the same time as this desperate search for capitalist (re)legitimacy, does not bode well for any of us.</p><p>These and more horrific exterminist forces are firmly in the driver&#8217;s seat, enjoying victory after victory, accumulating greater and greater resources to remake the world into a form more hospitable to their political project(s), and in the course of this self-annihilation they are likely closing the doors on various futures forever&#8212;though it will be a long time before we learn which options are lost to us forever. </p><p>This unholy alliance&#8212;far-right oligarch-ideologues who think democracy and capitalism are incompatible, tech firms with laboratories innovating the armament of fascism, financiers eager to transform speculation into wealth into power, and a host of other demoniacs&#8212;is relatively insulated from the public, its concerns, its pressures, its frustrations, and the few levers connected to those that could effect a change. And as a result, it enjoys relatively unimpeded power in building, expanding and legitimizing a police state in this country&#8212;a country that has, for a long time now, committed itself to surveillance, social control, force, projection, arbitrary violence, and terror. </p><p>It is increasingly unclear to me what, if anything, can be done about this. Though I suppose we&#8217;re all struggling with that problem right now. I&#8217;ll leave you with the end of Thanatos Triumphant, one of Mike Davis&#8217; last essays and one of my favorites:</p><blockquote><p>As an objection to my pessimism, one might claim that China is clear-sighted where everyone else is blind. Certainly, its vast vision of a unified Eurasia, the Belt and Road project, is a grand design for the future, unequalled since the sun of the &#8216;American Century&#8217; rose over a war-shattered world. But China&#8217;s genius, 1949-59 and 1979-2013, has been its neo-mandarin practice of collective leadership, centralized but plurivocal. Xi Jinping, in his ascent to Mao&#8217;s throne, is the worm in the apple. Although he has economically and militarily enhanced China&#8217;s clout, his reckless unleashing of ultra-nationalism could yet open a nuclear Pandora&#8217;s Box.</p><p>We are living through the nightmare edition of &#8216;Great Men Make History&#8217;. Unlike the high Cold War when politburos, parliaments, presidential cabinets and general staffs to some extent countervailed megalomania at the top, there are few safety switches between today&#8217;s maximum leaders and Armageddon. Never has so much fused economic, mediatic and military power been put into so few hands. It should make us pay homage at the hero graves of Aleksandr Ilyich Ulyanov, Alexander Berkman and the incomparable Sholem Schwarzbard.</p></blockquote>]]>

I did a reverse image search to try and credit the illustrator (and remember how I came across it), which turned up a few things. One was a <a href="https://x.com/bigblackjacobin/status/1790489347889721478">May 2024 quote tweet of mine</a> where I simply posted the picture. Another was <a href="https://newnoisemagazine.com/interviews/interview-steve-perrino-of-walking-wounded-talks-bestial-condemnation/">a </a><em><a href="https://newnoisemagazine.com/interviews/interview-steve-perrino-of-walking-wounded-talks-bestial-condemnation/">New Noise Magazine</a></em><a href="https://newnoisemagazine.com/interviews/interview-steve-perrino-of-walking-wounded-talks-bestial-condemnation/"> interview</a> with a Cleveland, Ohio heavy metal core band called Walking Wounded that used this painting for their debut EP, <em>Bestial Condemnation</em> and captured better than I initially did why the picture was perfect:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;<em>Bestial Condemnation</em> is a fantasy story about an aging knight who makes a deal with an ancient deity to restore his former strength,&#8221; begins guitarist Steve Perrino, &#8220;However, his newfound strength comes at the price of his humanity as he gradually devolves into something pre-human and violent.&#8221; Here&#8217;s a fitting central lyrical theme if there ever was one, given the quartet&#8217;s barbaric style.</p><p>&#8220;I think many of us wish we were stronger in a wide variety of ways, whether it&#8217;s physically, mentally, or emotionally,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;I wanted to write something that asks the listener, &#8216;<em>How far would you go to be the person you think you should be? What price would you pay? Will it be worth it?</em>&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>As I&#8217;ve been trying to argue in this series, it&#8217;s difficult to talk about why one might be opposed to how artificial intelligence is being designed, developed, financed, and deployed without bringing in a multitude of threads: </p><ul><li><p>the reactionary dream of prominent tech sector investors, entrepreneurs, thought leaders, and boosters to inoculate capitalism (and technological innovation) from democracy and liberalism</p></li><li><p>the accelerationist death cult of techno-optimists who believe the creation of a sufficiently advanced artificial intelligence will roll back whatever damage its pursuit wrecks on our ecological niche, culture, economy, political order, mental health, and so on</p></li><li><p>the origins of computation tracing back to the British empire&#8217;s hope of making industrial labor resemble plantation labor after the abolition of slavery, the extent to which reactionaries are eager to use these technologies to re-legitimize various hierarchies and forms of social control</p></li><li><p>our tech sector&#8217;s persistently lucrative strategy: overbuilding, overvaluing, and overinvesting in various assets in hopes of realizing excessive gains, translating those into political power, and undertaking the task of restructuring society in their desired image.</p></li></ul><p>It does not help that these concerns not only converge on artificial intelligence, but on a great deal of tech products foisted upon us by Silicon Valley leading up to it&#8212;namely those littering the so-called sharing economy, gig economy, metaverse, web3, and cryptoeconomy. Trillions of dollars have flowed to Wall Street and Silicon Valley to push out products seemingly designed to do nothing more than hurt as many people as possible while enriching as few as possible: sleek weapons for militaries and police forces, ubiquitous surveillance systems, vaporware, poorly designed Ponzi schemes, and elaborate conspiracies for printing out lottery tickets for distribution among a narrow group of bloodthirsty, skull-measuring, anti-social libertarians.</p><p>As Evgeny Morozov <a href="https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii116/articles/evgeny-morozov-digital-socialism">noted</a> in 2019&#8212;more than a decade since the start of the great financial crisis&#8212;capitalists remain uneasy:</p><blockquote><p>Once-alluring promises of meritocracy and social mobility ring increasingly hollow. They pine for a slicker, PowerPoint-friendly legitimation narrative&#8212;hard to concoct against a background of rising inequality, pervasive tax evasion and troubling omens about the true state of the post-crash global economy, were central bankers to withdraw their overextended support. What real-world developments could underpin such a narrative? What theme could make the idea of capitalism more morally acceptable to the latest batch of Ivy League graduates, who may risk getting drawn to notions like eco-socialism? Despite the growing &#8216;tech-lash&#8217; against the <strong>FAANGS</strong>, capitalist thinkers still look to Silicon Valley and its culture with a glimmer of hope. For all its problems, the Valley remains a powerful laboratory of new&#8212;perhaps, better&#8212;market solutions. No other sector occupies such a prominent role on the horizon of the Western capitalist imaginary or offers such a promising field for regenerative mythologies.</p></blockquote><p>Those words are no less true six years later&#8212;in fact, after the end of the ZIRP era it&#8217;s hard to understand the ongoing tech asset bubble, and the role it&#8217;s playing in promulgating artificial intelligence, without appreciating the legitimacy crisis plaguing capitalism.</p><p>It feels increasingly obvious that almost everything will be sacrificed to preserve the status quo, that we will be forced on an impossible path&#8212;giving birth to a superhuman artificial intelligence in hopes of improving our work lives, social lives, economies, politics, health, intelligence, and culture<em>. </em>Getting there just happens to require prioritizing the private financing, development, and deployment of relevant technologies, as well as giving increasingly more political and economic power to firms and entrepreneurs and financiers responsible for sabotaging our environment, social relations, politics, culture, and economy.</p><p>What will the cost end up being at the end of the day?</p><h1><strong>AI == INDULGENCE </strong></h1><p>The general thrust here is that modern AI hype cycles have a religious texture to them: one layer resembles the grounds on which Martin Luther criticized the abuse of indulgences in the 95 Theses he pinned to a church door in 1517, another resembles the folk-ritual of sin-eating&#8212;where a meal (sometimes resting on a corpse) was consumed to essentially absolve the recently deceased of their sins. The former will be the focus of this essay.</p><h3>Indulgences in the Medieval Era</h3><p>Medieval Church doctrine held there was an eternal and temporal dimension to sin: the former could be forgiven by confession and genuine repentance, but the later persisted and carried consequences in this life and the next (in Purgatory). Additional acts of penance (prayer, fasting, charity, good works, etc.) were required then to remit temporal punishment. </p><p>Enter indulgences: think of them as a credit or certificate given after an act of penance, representing a commuting of the debt incurred by sin and a reduction of future time in Purgatory. The Church began selling indulgences&#8212;promising that the monetary exchange was equivalent to penance, and then issuing excessive indulgences to raise funds for, well, anything they could. Here is an illuminating section from <em>God's Bankers</em>, Gerald Posner's exhaustive history of the Vatican's finances:</p><blockquote><p>The early church's penances were often severe, including flogging, imprisonment, or even death. Although some indulgences were free, the best ones&#8212;promising the most redemption for the gravest sins&#8212;were expensive. The Vatican set prices according to the severity of the sin and they were initially available only to those who made a pilgrimage to Rome.</p><p>Indulgences helped Urban II in the eleventh century offset the church's enormous costs in subsidizing the first Crusades. He offered full absolution to anyone who volunteered to fight in 'God's army' and partial forgiveness for simply helping the Crusaders. Successive Popes became ever more creative in liberalizing the scope of indulgences and the ease with which devout Catholics could pay for them. By the early 1400s, Boniface IX&#8212;whose decadent spending kept the church under relentless financial pressure&#8212;extended indulgences to encompass sacraments, ordinations, and consecrations. A few decades later, Pope Paul II waived the need for sinners to make a pilgrimage to Rome. He authorized local bishops to collect the money and dispense the indulgences and also cleared them for sale at pilgrimage sites that had relics of saints. Sextus IV had an inspired idea: apply them to souls stuck in Purgatory. Any Catholic could pay so that souls trapped in Purgatory could get on a fast track to Heaven. The assurance that money alone could cut the afterlife in Purgatory was such a powerful inducement that many families sent their life savings to Rome. So much money flooded to Sextus that he was able to build the Sistine Chapel. Alexander VI&#8212;the Spanish Borgia whose Papacy was marked by nepotism and brutal infighting for power&#8212;created an indulgence for simply reciting the Rosary in public. The new sales pitch promised the faithful that a generous contribution multiplied the Rosary's prayer power.</p><p>Each Pontiff understood that tax revenues from the Papal States paid most of the day-to-day bills, while indulgences paid for everything else. The church overlooked the widespread corruption and graft inherent in collecting so much cash and instead grew ever more dependent on indulgences. And as they got ever easier to buy and promised more forgiveness, they became wildly popular among ordinary Catholics.</p><p>Indulgences were, however, more than a financial lifeline. They also helped medieval Roman Popes withstand challenges to their secular power. So-called antipopes&#8212;usually from other Italian cities&#8212;claimed they, rather than the pope elected in Rome, had the political or divine right to rule the Catholic Church. Although some antipopes raised their own armies and had popular backing, they never mustered the moral authority to issue indulgences. Repeated efforts over centuries by pretenders to the Papacy to package and sell forgiveness for sins failed. Few Catholics believed that anyone but the Roman Pope had the direct connection with God to offer a real Indulgence. And when the Pope's armies were called upon to sometimes crush an antipope, it was usually the flood of cash from indulgences that paid for the war.</p></blockquote><p>Pope Leo X (1513-21), a Medici prince who'd been a wealthy and powerful cardinal since the age of 13, wasted no time bringing over his lavish lifestyle to the Papal Court when he ascended at 38. As Posner points out: Leo commissioned major artists for extravagant projects decorating Vatican estates, the Vatican's servants "nearly doubled to seven hundred," cardinals were soon called "Princes of the Church," and critics of his abuse of indulgences were threatened with excommunication. </p><p>Hoping to subsidize the cost of constructing St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica, Leo X issued a bull of plenary indulgence in 1515: the temporal punishment for almost any sin could now be remitted in exchange for money, and for the next 8 years all other indulgence promotion was to cease. For 8 years, this <strong>one </strong>indulgence could put you on the fast track to Heaven! Or as Luther claimed on Dominican friar, Johann Terzl, said: "&#8220;As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs.&#8221;</p><p>There are a few key areas of Luther&#8217;s critique that I&#8217;ll hone in and map onto artificial intelligence and we&#8217;ll develop them more in the next section:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Salvation through transaction. </strong>Indulgences shouldn&#8217;t be presented as a shortcut to salvation you can take instead of faith in God, genuine repentance, or good works motivated by the previous two. Luther's Theses don't oppose indulgences so much as the idea that the living (specifically the Papacy) can know whether sin can be remitted, especially when this remission is via a financial transaction and not a good work or genuine repentance. </p><ol><li><p><em>&#8220;That power which the pope has in general over purgatory corresponds to the power which any bishop or curate has in a particular way in his own diocese and parish. The pope does very well when he grants remission to souls in purgatory, not by the power of the keys, which he does not have, but by way of intercession for them.&#8221;</em> (Theses 25-26)</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Centralizing and codifying unjustified power. </strong>To suggest indulgences could be granted to the living on behalf of souls in Purgatory represented a massive overreach on the part of the Church, which was now suggesting it had authority over Purgatory. Introducing a commercial dimension to indulgences added perverse incentives that distorted the Church's mission and prioritized a host of needs which had nothing to do with Christendom. </p><ol><li><p><em>&#8220;They preach only human doctrines who say that as soon as the money clinks into the money chest, the soul flies out of purgatory. It is certain that when money clinks in the money chest, greed and avarice can be increased; but when the church intercedes, the result is in the hands of God alone.&#8221; </em>(Theses 27-28)</p></li></ol></li></ol><h3>Indulgences in the Modern Era</h3><p>One place to start is with &#8220;solutionism&#8221; which was first proposed by Morozov as the zealous belief that the application of technology can solve humanity's problems given the right algorithm, product, or private-public partnership. The degree to which various technologies cause disruption is the degree to which we are working through the inefficiency of its uneven adoption, a stratagem that conveniently reinforces the urgency of pursuing political programs prioritizing the uncritical adoption of new products, business models, asset classes, and regulatory frameworks (i.e. on-demand platforms, fintech, crypto, web3, metaverse, artificial intelligence). As Morozov puts it in &#8220;To Save Everything, Click Here&#8221;: </p><blockquote><p>Recasting all complex social situations either as neatly defined problems with definite, computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that can be easily optimized&#8212;if only the right algorithms are in place!&#8212;this quest is likely to have unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address.</p></blockquote><p>On a basic level, the drive to push for universal fixes through the application of breakthrough technologies may be offered as a shortcut that bypasses the onerous  hard work of enacting structural reforms, imposing ethical limitations, or adopting restrictive regulations that trade endless growth or progress for intentional development. It insists social problems are just market opportunities waiting for a bold entrepreneur. Public goods and services are mismanaged assets that should be made private, expediently.</p><p>Over the years, Morozov&#8217;s articulation of solutionism has evolved along with the focus of his analysis. In a 2023 <em>New York Times</em> op-ed, Morozov warned that solutionism had re-emerged as "digital neoliberalism" and was finding even more zealous adherents thanks to the invocation of artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I. This technology, its boosters hold, is inevitable, will likely be beneficial, and is really the only way to solve humanity's problems. </p><blockquote><p>Unbeknown to its proponents, A.G.I.-ism is just a bastard child of a much grander ideology, one preaching that, as Margaret Thatcher memorably put it, there is no alternative, not to the market. </p><p>Rather than breaking capitalism, as Mr. Altman has hinted it could do, A.G.I. &#8212; or at least the rush to build it &#8212; is more likely to create a powerful (and much hipper) ally for capitalism&#8217;s most destructive creed: neoliberalism.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>[N]eoliberalism is far from dead. Worse, it has found an ally in A.G.I.-ism, which stands to reinforce and replicate its main biases: that private actors outperform public ones (the market bias), that adapting to reality beats transforming it (the adaptation bias) and that efficiency trumps social concerns (the efficiency bias). </p><p>These biases turn the alluring promise behind A.G.I. on its head: Instead of saving the world, the quest to build it will make things only worse.</p></blockquote><p>The market bias compels two phases in any technology rollout, but especially A.G.I.'s: a first phase where heavily subsidized services offered, then a second where prices are hiked and "overdependent users and agencies" are bled dry to make the venture generate profits (and reshape consumer behavior, regulatory frameworks, market dynamics, and political orders into forms more hospitable to profits and rents)</p><p>This plank can be understood as vulgar solutionism, which was on full display with the <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/03/silicon-valley-bank-rescue-venture-capital-calacanis-sacks-ackman-tantrum.html">wave of frothy Silicon Valley startups that thrived during the zero-interest rate period</a>, but has now been supercharged with the rise of the A.G.I.-ism cult. As Ed Zitron has spent <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-is-a-systemic-risk-to-the-tech-industry-2/">newsletter</a> after <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/reality-check/">newsletter</a> after <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/optimistic-cowardice/">newsletter</a> detailing, there is a fundamental profitability issue at the heart of the generative AI business model&#8212;which is the sector actively pursuing A.G.I. Firms that have yet to turn a profit are burning through tens of billions, interested in raising hundreds of billions, and forecasting they will need trillions&#8212;who is going to fork up all that cash? Well, you (and me):</p><blockquote><p>Thus, the ugly retrenchment phase, with aggressive price hikes to make an A.G.I. service profitable, might arrive before &#8220;abundance&#8221; and &#8220;flourishing.&#8221; But how many public institutions would mistake fickle markets for affordable technologies and become dependent on OpenAI&#8217;s expensive offerings by then?</p><p>And if you dislike your town outsourcing public transportation to a fragile start-up, would you want it farming out welfare services, waste management and public safety to the possibly even more volatile A.G.I. firms?</p></blockquote><p>Then there's the adaptation bias, the idea that technological fixes can make us more self-reliant and resilient. Technology is not here to fix your city&#8217;s ailing infrastructure or to improve its social programs, but it can help you navigate their perpetual decline and evisceration! </p><blockquote><p>The message is clear: gear up, enhance your human capital and chart your course like a start-up. And A.G.I.-ism echoes this tune. Bill Gates has <a href="https://archive.ph/o/up8pv/https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun">trumpeted</a> that A.I. can &#8220;help people everywhere improve their lives.&#8221;</p><p>The solutionist feast is only getting started: Whether it&#8217;s fighting the next <a href="https://archive.ph/o/up8pv/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-15/how-to-stop-the-next-pandemic-from-happening-ai-big-data-and-vaccines">pandemic</a>, the <a href="https://archive.ph/o/up8pv/https://www.salon.com/2023/05/21/tech-wants-ai-chatbots-to-help-ease-loneliness-experts-are-skeptical/">loneliness epidemic</a> or <a href="https://archive.ph/o/up8pv/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-04/artificial-intelligence-is-argentina-s-latest-tool-to-combat-inflation">inflation</a>, A.I. is already pitched as an all-purpose hammer for many real and imaginary nails. However, the decade lost to the solutionist folly reveals the limits of such technological fixes.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>There&#8217;s a difference between nudging us to follow our walking routines &#8212; a solution that favors individual adaptation &#8212; and understanding why our towns have no public spaces to walk on &#8212; a prerequisite for a politics-friendly solution that favors collective and institutional transformation.</p><p>But A.G.I.-ism, like neoliberalism, sees public institutions as unimaginative and not particularly productive. They should just adapt to A.G.I., at least according to Mr. Altman, who recently said he was nervous about &#8220;the speed with which our institutions can adapt&#8221; &#8212; part of the reason, he added, &#8220;of why we want to start deploying these systems really early, while they&#8217;re really weak, so that people have as much time as possible to do this.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This brings us to the effiency bias, or the idea that complexity (i.e. morality, social good, justice, etc.) gets in the way of optimal market outcomes.</p><blockquote><p>This fixation on efficiency is how we arrived at &#8220;solving&#8221; climate change by letting the <a href="https://archive.ph/o/up8pv/https://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-big-polluters-win-carbon-credit-windfall-7451d966">worst offenders</a> continue as before. The way to avoid the shackles of regulation is to devise a scheme &#8212; in this case, taxing carbon &#8212; that lets polluters buy credits to match the extra carbon they emit.</p><p>This culture of efficiency, in which markets measure the worth of things and substitute for justice, inevitably corrodes civic virtues.</p><p>And the problems this creates are visible everywhere. Academics <a href="https://archive.ph/o/up8pv/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/opinion/sunday/colleges-measure-learning-outcomes.html">fret</a> that, under neoliberalism, research and teaching have become commodities. Doctors <a href="https://archive.ph/o/up8pv/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/technology/microsoft-ai-human-reasoning.html">lament</a> that hospitals prioritize more profitable services such as elective surgery over emergency care. Journalists hate that the worth of their articles is measured in <a href="https://archive.ph/o/up8pv/https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-communications/jonah-peretti-has-regrets-about-buzzfeed-news">eyeballs</a>.</p><p>Now imagine unleashing A.G.I. on these esteemed institutions &#8212; the university, the hospital, the newspaper &#8212; with the noble mission of &#8220;fixing&#8221; them. Their implicit civic missions would remain invisible to A.G.I., for those missions are rarely quantified even in their annual reports &#8212; the sort of materials that go into training the models behind A.G.I.</p><p>After all, who likes to boast that his class on Renaissance history got only a handful of students? Or that her article on corruption in some faraway land got only a dozen page views? Inefficient and unprofitable, such outliers miraculously survive even in the current system. The rest of the institution quietly subsidizes them, prioritizing values other than profit-driven &#8220;efficiency.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>In defense of A.G.I. and the fundraising various firms have undertaken to realize it (or to finally see a return, whether or not A.G.I. ever happens), this ideology&#8217;s zealots have constructed a variety of artifices that obscure the real costs of their activity as well as the extent to which it&#8217;s solely self-interested and far removed from anything resembling the public interest. </p><p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/the-silicon-valley-consensus-and">laid out before</a>, Silicon Valley&#8217;s race to build as many data centers as possible (AI capital expenditures, or AI capex) necessitates that the sector and its financiers overbuild, overvalue, and overinvest in compute <strong>and</strong> energy infrastructure. </p><p>AI infrastructure is downstream of cloud compute infrastructure, which is dominated by a few monopolistic firms that embrace deeply exploitative business practices to leverage &#8220;hyperscale&#8221; to extract rents, steal ideas, deter competitors, trap clients, and enter new-markets with built-in advantages. This infrastructure is overbuilt, overvalued, and overinvested in because of the opportunity to create a new market that resembles cloud&#8217;s ability to deliver rents, generate anti-competitive market intelligence, and realize juicy profit margins&#8212;to realize levels of growth and profit only possible when a market is rigged.</p><p>When it comes to energy infrastructure, there are a few concerns that emerge. First and foremost is that the fossil fuel industry wants to power AI infrastructure and be powered by it. Major tech firms have made it clear that they view sustainability commitments as limitations and fossil fuel firms are scrambling to help them curtail them. To this end, AI firms have committed to worsening the climate crisis by selling tools that boost fossil fuel extraction, exponentially build out energy-intensive compute, and give fossil fuel firms alongside utilities new excuses to overbuild infrastructure that will be subsidized by ratepayers (you and me).</p><p>The ways in which compute and energy infrastructure overbuilding, overvaluation, and overinvesting are rationalized, then, are what we should be worried about. I&#8217;m going to quote Zitron at length for a bit since he&#8217;s been great on the costs, externalities, illusions, and delusions at play here.</p><p>In July 2024, Zitron raises a few questions about the mechanism by which OpenAI&#8217;s valuation </p><blockquote><p>As part of this deal, Microsoft has effectively purchased the rights to OpenAI's "pre-AGI" technology, and licensed all of its technology in a way that extends past any partnership or, I imagine, future deals. Microsoft also "invested" in cloud credits at an indeterminate valuation, both in how OpenAI was valued <em>and the credits themselves.</em></p><p>Ask yourself, what is a dollar of "cloud compute credits," and what do they gain you access to?<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing?ref=wheresyoured.at#Estimate-and-budget"> Microsoft's Azure cloud has many, many products,</a> and it's unclear if OpenAI would receive preferential pricing on them, what products they'd be using, and the terms under which OpenAI receives them. Microsoft effectively created its own currency to invest in OpenAI, which OpenAI would then pay Microsoft in, which Microsoft would, in turn, receive as revenue.</p></blockquote><p>In September, he expresses concern that the issue is not just OpenAI's valuation, but a "subprime AI crisis" borne out of countless companies integrating generative AI priced at unsustainably low prices. (Recall Morozov&#8217;s argument that the A.G.I. cult, succumbing to neoliberalism's market bias, would roll out their products in two phases: heavy subsidies to undercut competition and cultivate user dependency, then price hikes to extract rents, generate first profits, and reshape users/markets/regulatory regimes/governance to be a more pliant (profitable) host body.)</p><p>Back to Zitron and the subprime AI crisis:</p><blockquote><p>Almost every "AI-powered" startup that uses LLM features is based on some combination of GPT or Claude. These models are built by two companies that are deeply unprofitable (<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/anthropic-projected-to-burn-more-than-2-7-billion-in-cash-this-year?rc=kz8jh3&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at">Anthropic is on course to lose $2.7 billion this year</a>), and that have pricing designed to get more customers rather than make any kind of profit.

However, let's consider for a fact that the numbers reported by The Information<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-openai-could-lose-5-billion-this-year?ref=wheresyoured.at&amp;rc=kz8jh3"> estimate that OpenAI's server costs with Microsoft will be $4 billion in 2024</a> &#8212; which, I add, are over two-and-a-half-times <em>cheaper</em> than what Microsoft charges others &#8212; and then consider that OpenAI <em>still loses over five billion dollars a year</em>.</p><p>OpenAI is more than likely charging only a small percentage of what it likely costs to run its models, and can only continue to do so if it is able to continually raise more venture funding than has ever been raised <strong>and</strong> continue to receive preferential pricing from Microsoft,<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/microsoft-says-openai-is-now-a-competitor-in-ai-and-search.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"> a company that recently mentioned that it considers OpenAI a competitor</a>. While I can't say for certain, I would think it's reasonable to believe that Anthropic receives similarly-preferential pricing from both Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.</p><p>Assuming that Microsoft gave OpenAI $10 billion of cloud credits, and it spent $4 billion on <em>server costs </em>and, let's say, $2 billion on training &#8212; costs that are both sure to increase with the new o1 and &#8220;Orion&#8221; models &#8212; OpenAI will either need more credits or will have to start paying actual cash to Microsoft sometime in 2025.</p></blockquote><p>Later that month, Zitron wrote about another potential red flag in the tech sector, cloud compute&#8212;specifically, the centrality of &#8220;software as a service service&#8221; (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;) to the business models of multiple tech companies, the stagnating growth of a business unit that usually prints money for firms, and the desperation which has driven these firms to overbuild, overvalue, and overinvest in generative AI:</p><blockquote><p>As I hinted earlier, I see the enterprise and the SaaS market as the commercial real estate arm of <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/subprimeai/">the Subprime AI Crisis</a> &#8212; an industry desperate for growth attaching itself to an unprofitable, unsustainable technology that they invested in in the hopes that it would fuel a decade or more of revenue growth.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>At some point, the putrid margins around generative AI will begin to eat into the already-tenuous profitability of these companies, leading to some, I imagine, having to either vastly increase prices or drop the tools altogether, assuming that the competitive landscape doesn't mean that keeping them is a <em>necessity</em> to compete with others.</p><p>If that's the case, many SaaS companies may have added the equivalent of an adjustable-rate mortgage to their tech stacks, all to offer features that are at best sort of cool and at worst actively harmful to a company. And based on the fact that most of these companies have to effectively double prices to offer AI, it's hard to imagine that these features aren't already problematically-expensive to maintain.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>Another deeply-worrying eventuality could be a race to the bottom, where growth-hungry SaaS companies either deeply discount or don't charge for AI, pushing their competitors to lower the price on their already-unprofitable products. Much like the feared commercial real estate bubble, SaaS may see its own series of dramatic price cuts to its AI tools as a means of competing and showing growth to the markets...despite the costs staying the same, or possibly increasing.</p><p>And, again, much like commercial real estate, AI has locked-in costs, and service providers have little incentive to drop them. Especially in the case of Microsoft, which will likely <em>only </em>ever make money from AI by selling compute.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>It's hard to overstate the significance of a collapse of growth in the SaaS market, as is it hard to overstate how dangerous generative AI is to its fortunes. While these companies had <em>costs</em> before, generative AI is multitudes higher than regular cloud compute costs, meaning that any new revenue growth from this software will be burdened by leveraging an increasingly-expensive solution to a problem that most of them have trouble describing.</p></blockquote><p>In February of this year, Zitron wrote a great essay breaking down the ways in which people used contrived metrics to insist "generative AI is a sustainable or real industry at the trillion-dollar scale" which justified externalized costs to various parts of our society that A.G.I. cultists were eager to subject to neoliberal dogma (e.g. privatization, adaptation, and efficiency maximization):</p><blockquote><p>Generative AI is a financial, ecological and social time bomb, and I believe that it's fundamentally damaging the relationship between the tech industry and society, while also shining a glaring, blinding light on the disconnection between the powerful and regular people.

That comes at a cost &#8212; when companies rule supreme, people lose their ability to assert their voice in the political process and democracy cannot hold.</p></blockquote><p>It is relatively easy (read: lazy) to delegate technological innovation to a sector that purports to be single-mindedly dedicated to it. But as Hao muses, you wouldn&#8217;t go along with this if fossil fuel firms said &#8220;we alone should be allowed to look into climate change.&#8221; (Well, some people would and do.) This surrender of control over our technology has been made easier still by the ease with which Silicon Valley and a persistently obsequious tech media have accepted and promulgated talking points that affirm this self-serving status quo.</p><p>In the past, fear of God worked as a key pillar in rationalizing the sale of indulgences so that one could sidestep it&#8212;today, firms like OpenAI have embraced a similar marketing strategy:<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2023-03-31/column-afraid-of-ai-the-startups-selling-it-want-you-to-be"> fear of our stillborn god, AGI</a>. Promising to revolutionize human civilization and solve all our ills, Altman traveled the globe searching for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhsrYDglnx7MtNG_9qpo3MXqvjg1ldBWBz4Qly3u_1GUYJKaZ34Io057PfNw00%3D&amp;gaa_ts=683b7244&amp;gaa_sig=Da5FYKbf8DlVL4Fcch7hedOzzbQPTkv2gDceOo1W94E21dBWZHK-kg75Ud_C2g8K5R1TE93iVG8lbQ7qYXbOog%3D%3D">$7 trillion in investments</a> to kickoff humanity&#8217;s salvation. The fever dream has moderated <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/measures/">significantly since then</a>, now anticipating AGI at a date ranging from this year to soon!</p><p>Today&#8217;s indulgences take a variety of forms, but at their core feature artifices deployed to sustain this unsustainable enterprise. </p><p>Why reduce your own emissions when you can utilize renewable energy credits, a creative accounting scheme that allows you to secure certificates that show you&#8217;ve bought renewable-energy generated electricity produced off-site, even though you don&#8217;t have to actually consume it. A September 2024 <em>Guardian</em> analysis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/15/data-center-gas-emissions-tech">found</a> that data center emissions from Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple are likely 662 percent higher than officially reported. Buy a literal certificate to avoid doing the hard structural reform and carry on with business as usual! </p><p>Maybe you want to help other firms claim they&#8217;re reducing emissions? Follow Microsoft's lead: last year, Hao <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/09/microsoft-ai-oil-contracts/679804/">reported</a> on how Microsoft claimed it was reducing the emissions of fossil fuel companies by selling them AI tools that allowed them to more efficiently find and develop oil and gas reserves, maximizing production at those sites. Yes, we <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34497394/">must stop doing this</a> if we are interested in preserving our ecological niche, but the only way we can actually do so is by developing AI tools that generate revenues and profits as well as demand for renewable energy infrastructure which can power greater and greater levels of compute which can then eventually give rise to a breakthrough technology that will save us.</p><p>Perhaps you are more interested in the compute infrastructure side? Want to structure investments linked to cloud compute &amp; preferential prices to keep major firms afloat (OpenAI&#8212;Microsoft/Google&#8212;Anthropic&#8212;Amazon) while they figure out how to fix <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/01/20/openais-latest-model-will-change-the-economics-of-software">unprofitable business models and unsustainable unit economics</a>? Or maybe you would like to gin up demand along each node of the generative AI supply chain by pursuing <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/deep-impact/">a specific vision of artificial intelligence that requires more GPUs, more clusters, larger and more compute-intensive models, more data, more data centers</a>, more, more, more, until somewhere along the way you can grow your way into your first profits? Concerned that you won&#8217;t be able to <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-is-a-systemic-risk-to-the-tech-industry-2/">secure larger and larger infusions of capital to justify larger and larger valuations as you prognosticate about larger and larger ambitions for your increasingly unprofitable enterprise?</a> In each instance, the solution clearly is to just deploy more capital, to spend more money plodding along in the same direction until you are saved.</p><p>The indulgence economy for artificial intelligence is a simple one. Artificial intelligence will save the world. The firms advancing artificial intelligence will save the world. They will need as much water, land, coal, natural gas, electricity, talent, and money as possible to do this. They will need unimpeded access to as much personal data as possible, as much intellectual property as possible, as much freedom to control and reshape markets and consumer behavior as possible, as much debt as possible, as much investor capital and as much government treasuries as possible. </p><p>If artificial intelligence is contributing to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html">mass illiteracy and cheating</a>, it is because you dragged your feet on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/openai-releases-a-teachers-guide-to-chatgpt-but-some-educators-are-skeptical/">adopting it (or adapting to it) in the classroom</a>.

Close your eyes and fork over some cash to fix this with artificial intelligence.</p><p>And so on, and so on. </p><p>Change, it goes, can only be realized by exchanging some coin in the direction of our saboteurs. It&#8217;s hard to break out of the brain-dead political imaginations that tell us the financing, design, development, and deployment of technology should be left in the hands of an insular network of libertarians and reactionaries more interested in surveillance, force projection, and social control than anything resembling the public good. Harder still when those preserving such a broken political order have figured out <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2024/09/19/venture-backed-trumpism-ben-tarnoff/">there is money to be made, even when there are no profits to be made</a>. So long as you can convince people that it&#8217;s worth externalizing the moral costs (onto everyone else) and eschewing accountability (for harms visited on everyone else), then you can maximize returns, wealth, and power. What else matters?</p><h4>Centralizing and codifying unjustified power</h4><p>It is abundantly clear by now that the variety of firms interested in artificial intelligence and spending billions on it (e.g. OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, Amazon) have aligned the development of artificial intelligence in the direction of not just profit-seeking, but a wide-ranging ecosystem of delusions, distractions, detours, accounting tricks, speculative endeavors, political projects, and (de)regulatory overhauls that are about, repeat it after me, <em>turning speculative gains into real wealth into political power</em> that can make repeating this alchemical transmutation that much easier.</p><p>Building on his A.G.I.-ism thesis, Morozov <a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/can-ai-break-out-of-panglossian-neoliberalism/">offers</a> "Panglossian neoliberalism" as a term aimed at capturing how Big Tech has captured our institutional and infrastructural imagination:</p><blockquote><p>Championed by venture capitalists, tech CEOs, and startup founders, this credo asserts that we already live in the best of all possible worlds (reflecting its Panglossian aspects) and that there is no alternative to the market-driven provision of our tech infrastructures (reflecting its neoliberal aspect). The essence of this ideology is distilled in the recent <em><a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">Techno-Optimist Manifesto</a></em> by Marc Andreessen, the prominent venture capitalist, who flatly states: &#8220;free markets are the most effective way to organize a technological economy.&#8221;</p><p>As history, the dogmas of Panglossian neoliberalism are at best na&#239;ve, ignoring the significant Cold War&#8211;era public spending, much of it military, that created Silicon Valley. ARPANET, Global Positioning System (GPS), the integrated circuit, and the computer mouse all stem from government funding, not free markets. But the damage doesn&#8217;t stop with bad history. Politically, this ideology often results in paralysis, hindering the search for local, experimental, and democratic alternatives to the market-driven paradigm that dominates our technology stack.</p></blockquote><p>Silicon Valley has spent a long while now insisting that our analyses should focus only on markets, but through incredibly ahistorical narratives that have less to do with understanding reality than they do with manipulating it. As I&#8217;ve laid out before, Silicon Valley&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/san-francisco-silicon-valley-eugenics/">origin story</a> is one steeped in eugenics and environmental decay, with dreams of global domination fed by blood and soil, conquest and genocide, surveillance and control, war and insurgency. It has always been about power. </p><p>As I&#8217;ve written elsewhere:</p><blockquote><p>The bounties of farmlands and the underworld mines grew and grew. The sciences that developed both helped those industries metastasize larger swaths of the land. A few individuals generated dynastic fortunes that helped build newspaper empires, propaganda campaigns, monuments and memorials, all aimed at inspiring and sustaining the waves of bodies feeding into the megamachine. More fortunes still were used to fund efforts to develop the knowledge, tools, and techniques to better dominate nature. Universities, laboratories, and corporations innovated tools of remote control to administer California&#8217;s depleted ecology and corral the populace. These forces shaped San Francisco&#8217;s development, and they never completely vanished.</p><p>The problem is that San Francisco&#8217;s <em>contado</em> is now the world&#8212;there are always more mines, more bodies, more forests, and more wealth to be extracted; and there will always be a need for tools and techniques to subordinate everything outside the city for some Great Work.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>There&#8217;s a dark side to nearly every tech venture.

Whether it&#8217;s cryptocurrency, web3, the metaverse, or on-demand platforms, Silicon Valley has tried (and failed) to insist their latest product is inevitable, revolutionary, and so transformative that they must be given an inordinate subsidies to see it through as well as as much autonomy as possible to control it unmolested by democratic oversight.</p><p>And yet, as Morozov points out, it is painfully obvious that the private provision of generative artificial intelligence has left us with the worst possible form on multiple counts:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Inefficiency and waste</strong>: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Meta, and a host of other firms are "duplicating efforts, building nearly identical resources with minor differences" that will require the same data sets, labor to treat them, and sprawling data centers that consume water and electricity. OpenAI once claimed it needed $7 trillion, in what world does it make sense to let each one of these firms independently burn trillions?</p></li><li><p><strong>Subpar quality of services</strong>: Hyper-competition incentivizes firms to "bypass adequate oversight" and push through products that frequently hallucinate, fail on simple tasks, and cover up significant security and privacy breaches. </p></li><li><p><strong>Inadequate compensation for those who helped train the models</strong>: There is no hope for fairly compensating those who create original content used to train models under the current regime. AI boosters regularly claim that such compensation would destroy their enterprise completely, not that this stops firms developing AI from stealing as much as they can without compensation. The few institutions that can secure deals (such as media organizations) are doing so for the company itself, not for every single worker involved in creating the original work that's part of these licensing deals. The insistence that the solution must benefit these AI firms first and foremost is not a natural one, and Morozov points out how we could easily empower a public entity to implement "differentiated access rules based on public policy priorities" that fleece AI firms while providing free/low-cost access to everyone else.</p></li><li><p><strong>Exclusion of non-corporate players from R&amp;D</strong>: Even the one goal articulated by generative AI firms&#8212;building our stillborn A.G.I. god&#8212;is just a fancy way of saying "serving the interests of its investors." Generative AI's development will be profit, not experimentation, not innovation, and often at the cost of our social relations, political sphere, privacy, cultural works, and environment. Without the inevitable birth of A.G.I., it is harder to pretend the debate is about stalling the creation of an epoch-defining technology and it becomes easier to see this is a distraction from considering alternatives to development solely by market forces. "In fields like education, healthcare, and transportation," Morozov writes, "we've recognized the market model's limitations and its tendency to erode cherished ideals. Shouldn'w we apply the same scrutiny to generative AI.&#8221;</p></li><li><p><strong>Lack of transparency about true costs</strong>: I've used Zitron's writings to repeatedly invoke this, it has come up in my own, and it has come up in Morozov's&#8212;a key part of AI's indulgence economy is obscuring the real cost of these products so that it is easier to make the pitch that salvation is cheaper and easier than the much harder task of pursuing alternatives. We do not know the sustainability of what these firms are offering is, only that they insist it will pay for itself one day.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increased technological dependency of the Global South on the Global North</strong>: Silicon Valley, our military, and our federal government have all said in one way or another that pursuing AI development is also about pursuing additional leverage over other countries&#8212;specifically China. Slowing AI development, breaking up the firms driving it, applying basic regulatory or democratic oversight, these are anathema as they would reduce American primacy in this field instead of deepending foreign dependence on our tech offerings. Is there any interest in a multi-polar global tech regime, with institutions interested in bolstering tech development in the Global South at the expense of the Global North? Likely not. And so the march continues on.</p></li><li><p><strong>The conservative bias inherent in these systems, which favor stability and predictability over novelty and variety</strong>: Corporate-driven generative AI is primarily concerned with profit-seeking, utilitarian efficiency, surveillance, social control, and the like. What would what Morozov calls "ecologically sophisticated generative intelligence" look like? Morozov imagines it being advanced by "institutions that genuinely value more than just predictability and efficiency, however monetizable those qualities may be." Will this require new institutions? Will we go back to the well and bolster those embedded in the welfare state, like libraries and museums (educational and cultural ones)? </p></li></ul><p>There is no hope of any of this to turn over within the &#8220;neoliberal straitjacket&#8221; that Silicon Valley has foisted upon us in its bid to consolidate its private control of computational infrastructure and the vast ecosystem needed to swell it. What is lost and what is gained when we prioritize a vision that aligns with centralizing private control of our technology?</p><p>We are left with voluntary AI ethics frameworks that lack any teeth, performative decrees that purport to govern and regulate the industry but are better understood as medieval papal bulls insisting on immaterial authority on tenuous grounds! We are left with AI ethicists who assume the inevitability of a far-flung possibility (AGI) and spill miles of ink crying out for guardrails and alignment safety protocols to ensure our science-fiction scenario arrives amicably, but who have nothing to say about a genocide going on <strong>right now</strong> where Israel is using AI tools to explicitly kill as many civilians as possible as it tries to ethnically cleanse Palestinians in Gaza. We are left with AI ethics boards that are quickly dissolved, ethics researchers that are censored and fired, and alignment that purports to avoid runaway AGI, but advances the proliferation of present AI to augment discrimination, surveillance, immiseration, exploitation, and extermination.</p><p>Is all of this worth it?</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">The Tech Bubble is a reader-supported publication.

				<![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone, this week&#8217;s roundup got a little long so I&#8217;m breaking it up. Today&#8217;s essay is partly a primer on 23andMe and partly an argument the real value of popularizing the idea that &#8220;genetic data is valuable&#8221; traces back to advancing reactionary projects eager for apartheid and desperate to purge capitalism of recent civilizing reforms stretching back to the New Deal. </p><p>At the end of the week, the roundup will drop and focus on some of our favorite subjects: abundance &amp; degrowth &amp; techno-optimism &amp; Luddism, the ongoing AI bubble, Trump&#8217;s Butlerian Jihad on the global economy, and China&#8217;s technological ascendance. I'll also be throwing in some book recommendations, a playlist, and some movie recommendations from my Diplomacy movie club. Look for that in your inbox at the end of the week.</p><p><em><strong>Some housekeeping</strong></em></p><p>Some lovely folks at NPR/KCRW brought me on to <em>Question Everything</em> and got me drunk while we talked about billionaires in February (listen <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/not-like-us-how-billionaires-think/id1765799296?i=1000696499517">here</a>). I met Douglas Rushkoff there and went on his <em>Team Human</em> show to talk more about Silicon Valley, episode forthcoming. I also went on <em>Trashfuture</em> (listen <a href="https://trashfuturepodcast.podbean.com/e/preview-pump-it-ft-ed-ongweso-jr/">here</a>) and <em>System Crash </em>(listen <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-promise-of-a-new-tech-era-ft-ed-ongweso-jr/id1780445651?i=1000698249445">here</a>) to talk about my <a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/the-silicon-valley-consensus-and">Silicon Valley Consensus essay</a>. I will also be going on Ed Zitron&#8217;s <em>Better Offline</em> this week to talk about the ongoing AI bubble (and hawk the Silicon Valley Consensus a bit more). The second half of my SVC essay will be coming out this week too and then I&#8217;ll push out the unified beast at <em>Security in Context</em> sometime later&#8212;stay tuned!</p><p>Over at <em>This Machine Kills</em> (the podcast I co-host with Jathan Sadowski), we just released our <strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/thismachinekillspod/400-well-somebody-has-to-do-something-ft-malcolm-harris">400th episode</a></strong>: we had an amazing conversation with author Malcolm Harris about his upcoming book WHAT&#8217;S LEFT, the three strategies it offers to save the world from ecological catastrophe, and how those pathways fit together into a larger vision. </p><p>On April 16, <em>The Drift</em> is convening a panel where I&#8217;ll talk alongside alongside Willy Staley, Sam Adler-Bell, and Delia Cai about Twitter&#8212;moderated by Elena Saavedra Buckley and hosted by NYU's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. Registration is closed, but stay tuned for livestream options&#8212;tune in if you&#8217;re around! I&#8217;ll also be on a panel at NYU on May 2nd to talk with Quinn Slobodian about his upcoming book HAYEK&#8217;S BASTARDS. Our TMK episode on his book will be coming out in two weeks. And it&#8217;s worth mentioning that our conversation with Slobodian is what inspired this essay that I&#8217;ve spun out of the coming roundup.</p><p><em>If you like my work and want to support me, consider becoming a paid subscriber for <strong>$7 a month</strong> (the price of a dozen eggs if you&#8217;re lucky) or <strong>$70 a year</strong> (the price of a few hardcover books you won&#8217;t read)!

As Adam Rutherford <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/27/geneticist-mourn-23andme-useless-health-information">points out</a> in <em>The Guardian</em>, it ultimately boiled down to a data-driven junk science business model:</p><blockquote><p>It didn&#8217;t invent direct-to-consumer genomics, but it made big data big business. The genius of its business model was not simply to get you to volunteer this personal data to a private company, but to persuade you to actually pay to give it to them. It then commercialised your DNA by selling it on to pharmaceutical companies, which would use it to develop drugs, ultimately for profit. It was the type of racket that a mob boss might look on and say: &#8220;And this is legal?&#8221; There was always an opportunity to opt out, but most people did not, because who reads the small print? And what did you get in exchange? A scientific trinket.</p></blockquote><p>That scientific trinket was supposed to shed light on where someone came from, as well as insights into hereditary health, but those offerings rarely held up to scrutiny:</p><blockquote><p>There is no method for identifying the geographical origin of your ancestors using genetics. Your ancestors about 50 generations back are <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/humans-are-all-more-closely-related-than-we-commonly-think/">from all over the world</a>, and besides, biology does not bestow membership to a tribe or clan or people or country. What 23andMe was actually doing was comparing your DNA to that of other paying customers, and matching up where they live today, and inferring that you have ancestors in that location. It kind of works, but is mostly meaningless. When the data lets you believe that you are 37% German, or 18% Spanish, or whatever, it might feel fun, but of course there is no way of being 37% German. White supremacists loved this type of service too because &#8211; locked into their scientifically ignorant ideology &#8211; they believed it would reveal some sort of racial purity. Even when testing uncovered previously unknown ancestry from people they deem inferior, they would often attribute the results to a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6939152/">Jewish conspiracy</a>.</p><p>As for the health information it provided, the results are also of profoundly limited use, because the tests are not designed to <a href="https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/direct-to-consumer-genetic-testing/">diagnose medical conditions</a>, and the genetic variants analysed as part of the service are derived from population-level<strong></strong>statistics, which are not particularly informative to individuals. I discovered that I have a genetic variant that at a population level is associated with a slightly higher risk of developing Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Knowing this neither bothers me nor has prompted a change in my behaviour. It does not mean that I will get Alzheimer&#8217;s, and if you don&#8217;t have that same variant it doesn&#8217;t mean you won&#8217;t.</p><p>DNA is not fate. 23andMe was trading on ignorance of how the genome actually works, and perpetuating a deterministic view of genetics that is outmoded and wrong.</p></blockquote><p>This is a great description of why 23andme&#8217;s business model was data-driven junk science, but doesn&#8217;t exactly tell us why it failed financially. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/30/how-venture-capitalists-are-deforming-capitalism">Silicon Valley financiers</a>, after all, will be the first to tell you that selling bullshit and making a profit are not mutually exclusive, but in fact hand in hand. Or you can simply <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/03/silicon-valley-bank-rescue-venture-capital-calacanis-sacks-ackman-tantrum.html">look with your eyes</a> at what Silicon Valley actually does with its Smuagian hoards?</p><p>Perhaps 23andMe going public via SPAC merger in 2021 should've been a giant red warning sign&#8212;as I <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-are-spacs-the-trend-blowing-up-the-finance-world/">wrote that year</a>, the SPAC frenzy kicked off because it was a lucrative way for firms with poor financials to enter public markets and for early financiers to con suckers into investing, using the new meat as a pathway for an exit.</p><p>In February 2021, its merger with Richard Branson's SPAC gave the company a $3.5 billion value that peaked at a $6 billion market capitalization. It's now hovering at $35 million, up from $19 million when bankruptcy was announced. This still doesn&#8217;t capture how bad things have shaken out, but here&#8217;s one financial commentator <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2025/03/24/spac-implosion-keeps-on-giving-genetic-data-of-15-million-customers-up-for-grabs-at-23andme-bankruptcy-auction/">on the day of 23andMe&#8217;s bankruptcy</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Branson&#8217;s SPAC went public via IPO at $10 a share in late 2020. It then acquired 23andMe at the company&#8217;s peak in revenues. The 1-for-20 reverse stock split last October turned each 20 shares [ME] into one share, and thereby turned the SPAC&#8217;s IPO price of $10 into $200. <strong>And today&#8217;s price of $0.73 would be $0.037 on a pre-reverse-split basis.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Early on, it became clear one of the major obstacles the company would have to overcome is that a customer only needs to order their genetic test once. Most of 23andMe's ventures were desperate attempts to eschew that limit. </p><p>When growth of the direct-to-consumer genetic tests stalled, 23andMe tried to generate a new revenue stream with its massive DNA hoard. The plan? Approach pharmaceutical giants interested in accelerating the development of new drugs and genetic therapies with access to 23andMe's DNA hoard. In 2018, 23andMe <a href="https://mediacenter.23andme.com/press-releases/gsk-and-23andme-sign-agreement-to-leverage-genetic-insights-for-the-development-of-novel-medicines/">inked a four-year deal</a> with GlaxoSmithKline that included a $300 million upfront investment and gave the drugmaker exclusive rights to use 23andMe's database for drug development. In 2022, GSK paid $50 million to <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-announces-extension-gsk-collaboration-and-update-joint">extend the partnership for a fifth year</a>, but 23andMe was unable to find another pharma partner afterwards&#8212;killing the hopes of recurring revenue through data licensing and IP rents, as well as the delusions about creating their own drug R&amp;D program.</p><p>Back in 2020, 23andMe launched <a href="https://blog.23andme.com/articles/23andmeplus">a premium subscription product</a> aimed at giving customers "more ways to engage in their personal genetics journey" with "impactful new genetic health reports, and enhanced health and ancestry features." This, too, failed to materialize sustainable recurring revenue. So with a fundamentally flawed business model and persistent failure to generate sustainable revenue, the writing was on the wall.</p><p>And back in 2021, 23andMe paid $400 million for Lemonaid, a telehealth and pharmacy startup, as part of a failed pivot into primary care services bolstered by "personalized" genetic insights. As <em>Stat+ News</em><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/10/22/23andme-lemonaid-telehealth-acquisition/">put it at the time</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;What are the chances 23andMe is going to be one of the last-standing, dominant players in telemedicine?&#8221; asked Erik Gordon, a health finance professor at the University of Michigan. &#8220;I would say the chances are very low.&#8221;</p><p>For one thing, Gordon said, telemedicine carries significant ongoing capital costs that 23andMe is not as well-positioned to manage as many of the bigger players, such as UnitedHealth Group, or even new, well-funded entrants like Amazon. <strong>A more fundamental challenge is linking the value of genetic testing to a primary care business where most of the care currently focuses on acute needs such as a bad cold or emergent illness.</strong></p><p>&#8220;The idea that you can inform primary care with genetic testing &#8212; it&#8217;s pretty hard to connect those dots,&#8221; Gordon said. &#8220;Lemonaid&#8217;s telehealth is for things like the flu, not for stuff where someone&#8217;s genome is going to be really important.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Even in this 2021 article, it's clear this is a desperate play made to "provide a lifeline for 23andMe's bottom line" and one that was likely to fail. 23andMe had at that point already laid of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/23andme-lays-off-100-people-ceo-anne-wojcicki-explains-why.html">14 percent of its staff in January 2020</a> after revenues dropped by more than $130 million since the previous year and the company projected it wouldn't make more until 2023. That milestone was never hit (the company never saw a profit), in September 2024 <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/biotech/23andme-board-resigns-in-new-blow-to-dna-testing-company-12f1a355">all seven independent directors on the company&#8217;s board resigned</a>, and in November 2024 it <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9z7m2nljyo">laid off 40 percent</a> of its workforce.</p><p>Revenue declined, losses grew, user growth slowed, partnerships never materialized, acquisition and R&amp;D costs mounted&#8212;the writing was on the wall for anyone who wanted to read it.

Sidestepping all this, it also doesn't help that this was clearly obvious even before the SPAC merger back in 2021. Take this <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04f9004c-181e-480e-91b2-6e422ae18cc9">Financial Times</a></em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04f9004c-181e-480e-91b2-6e422ae18cc9"> op-ed</a> from Hug Young Reinhoff Jr, who founded bio-tech startup DNA Sciences in 1998 with venture capital backing and board members like Jim Watson (one of the scientists who discovered DNA's double helix structure):</p><blockquote><p>On August 1, 2000 we launched the web-based Gene Trust, a platform to recruit patients online to participate in studies to identify the genetics of common disease. Thousands participated. At our peak we were spending $3mn a month.</p><p>Six years later, long after the demise of DNA Sciences, 23andMe essentially copied our efforts but focused almost entirely on brand creation making DNA collection &#8220;celebrity cool&#8221;. Indeed, they created significant brand awareness. What they apparently have not experienced was our own early &#8220;epiphany&#8221; that doing genetics was not a business model. This revelation was true for the other significant companies sequencing and genotyping &#8212; Incyte Corp, deCode Genetics, Celera Genomics, to name a few. Though deCode has been fantastically productive doing first-rate genetic studies, it nevertheless had to find a sponsor in Amgen to sustain its efforts. Indeed, Big Pharma, most significantly GSK, has &#8220;dabbled&#8221; in genetic studies to the tune of billions with very little to show for it over the last 25 years.</p><p>The brand equity of 23andMe has been destroyed and leaves a stain on such efforts, given the low quality of the personal medical data and the constant threat of breaches. DNA sequence is now a commodity and large-scale efforts, sponsored by the government and foundations such as UK Biobank, render commercial efforts inadequate and irrelevant.</p><p><strong>Genetics has an unbelievable allure, perhaps even more to non-geneticists, but most DNA data is gangue, not ore. It is the individual prospectors mining big DNA databases who occasionally hit pay dirt.</strong></p></blockquote><p>So if 23andMe, other bio-tech startups, and pharmaceutical giants can&#8217;t hit pay dirt when mining big DNA databases&#8230;who can? A few days after 23andMe declared bankruptcy, it revealed a U.S. judge ruled the company <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/03/28/23andme-bankruptcy-chapter-11-genetic-data-medical-ancestry-dna-silicon-valley-delete/">could sell customer medical and ancestry data</a> as part of the proceedings&#8212;prompting <a href="https://www.alabamaag.gov/attorney-general-marshall-warns-protect-personal-data-and-delete-23andme-accounts/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CGiven%20the%20uncertainty%20surrounding%2023andMe's,%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Attorney%20General%20Marshall.">multiple</a><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-urgently-issues-consumer-alert-23andme-customers">state</a><a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/23andme-georgia-ag-urges-residents-delete-accounts">attorney generals</a> to remind people that they can and should delete their data if they foolishly used the service over the years.</p><p>What could that data be used for? David Choffnes, a computer science professor at Northeastern University and executive director of its Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute, told <em>The Associated Press</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still other things that they are allowed to do with that data, including, as they mentioned, provide cross context, behavioral or targeted advertising,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So, you know, in a sense, even if they aren&#8217;t sending your personal data to an advertiser, there&#8217;s a long line of research that identifies how third parties can re-identify you from de-identified data by looking for patterns in it. And so if they&#8217;re targeting you with advertisements, for example, based on some information that they have about your genetic data, there&#8217;s probably a way that other parties could piece together other information they have access to.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>As Jason Koebler points out in 404Media, 23andMe (or whoever buys the data) could go even further:</p><blockquote><p>Other genetic sequencing companies have shared customer information with police and governments, pharmaceutical companies, and health insurers. GED Match, a non-profit that once claimed <a href="https://www.404media.co/23andme-hack-christmas-gift/">it would protect customers&#8217; genetic data</a>, was sold to a for-profit company called Verogen, which works with the FBI and was later sold to a Dutch multinational conglomerate. Police now regularly attempt to identify suspects using information pulled from commercial genetic databases like the one that 23andMe has created.</p><p>23andMe&#8217;s bankruptcy means that the company will be put up for sale, and there&#8217;s no way of knowing who is going to buy it, why they will be interested, and what will become of its millions of customers&#8217; DNA sequences. 23andMe has claimed over the years that it strongly resists law enforcement requests for information and that it takes customer security seriously. But the company has in recent years changed its terms of service, partnered with big pharmaceutical companies, and, of course, was hacked.</p></blockquote><p>And such concerns aren&#8217;t that far fetched&#8212;Koebler <a href="https://www.404media.co/open-source-genetic-database-opensnp-shuts-down-to-protect-users-from-authoritarian-governments/">also wrote about OpenSNP</a>, an open source genetic database that has collected about 7,500 genomes over the past 14 years, that recently shut down because of growing concerns about the country&#8217;s fascist lurch:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about it since 23andMe was on the verge of bankruptcy and been really considering it since the U.S. election. It definitely is really bad over there [in the United States],&#8221; Greshake Tzovaras told 404 Media. &#8220;I am quite relieved to have made the decision and come to a conclusion. It&#8217;s been weighing on my mind for a long time.&#8221;</p><p>Greshake Tzovaras said that he is proud of the OpenSNP project, but that, in a world where scientific data is being censored and deleted and where the Trump administration has focused on criminalizing immigrants and trans people, he now believes that the most responsible thing to do is to delete the data and shut down the project.</p></blockquote><p>Who else might be interested in your genetic data? Would you be surprised to learn that professional phrenologists like Charles Murray, who <a href="https://x.com/charlesmurray/status/1904286135825649941">suggested</a> that one of his billionaire friends should buy it for him. Joke or not, there are 1488 reasons why Murray might want access to the genetic data of millions of people.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>As Quinn Slobodian and Stuart Schrader <a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-white-man-unburdened-slobodian-schrader">write in 2018</a> for <em>The Baffler,</em> Murray has spent the past few decades looking for data to prove that "equality was elusive because it was impossible" given racial groups "wee unequal in their endowments and would remain so indefinitely." Murray's diligent massaging of data in <em>The Bell Curve</em> didn't lead to us abandoning the "egalitarian premise" quite like he hoped, but perhaps troves of genetic data in the right hands might do the trick. Perhaps we might be able to use science to show the cruel but sober rationality of his pleas for "social apartheid" or a "high-tech and more lavish version of the Indian reservation for some substantial minority of the nation's population, while the rest of America tries to go about its business." </p><p>Slobodian dives a bit deeper into the influence of Murray&#8217;s academic racism in a later paper titled <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/56/article/899272">&#8220;The Unequal Mind&#8221;</a> and the role genetic determinism&#8212;especially when advanced by phrenologists interested in gutting social programs&#8212;played in slashing and burning away at the welfare state. Consider this:</p><blockquote><p>An irony of the revival of racial science to oppose the welfare state is that the welfare state was designed, in part, to address fears of the degeneration of the race. The modern response to fears of degeneration or the deteriorating genetic quality of a population was to increase state intervention, including through public programs of nutrition, maternal training, public health, child benefits, family planning, and access to birth control. In extreme forms, this entailed forms of negative eugenics, including sterilizations of criminals and the mentally ill and, eventually, the extermination policies of Nazi Germany.</p></blockquote><p>The question for phrenologists, then, is how do you open the public&#8217;s third eye so that they realize the eugenic state, not the welfare state, is the answer to all our problems? How do you naturalize "a racial, ethnic, and gendered hierarchy of ability" as part of a larger campaign to purge society of egalitarianism? </p><p>This shit has <a href="https://unherd.com/2025/03/23andme-was-always-junk-science/">always</a> been junk science. Genetic data&#8217;s real value is not in discovering new drugs or gene therapies, nor in revolutionizing primary care, nor personalizing medicine, nor reducing the cost of health. The real value of genetic data is not as a commodity or a business model of its own. The real value is as an input to existing models (e.g. advertising) or reactionary projects (e.g. bolstering police or immigration authorities in a fascist polity) or undermining public empathy for others (e.g. naturalizing hierarchies that justify coercion or domination or exploitation), all as part of the desperate attempt by the least among us (skull measuring freaks, apartheid lovers, libertarians ghouls, free market jihadis, new fusionists, etc.) are undertaking to save capitalism by purging it of recent half-hearted reforms in response to social movements over the years.</p><p>In the aforementioned essay, as well as his forthcoming book &#8220;Hayek&#8217;s Bastards,&#8221; Slobodian hammers this point home well but I&#8217;ll close this out with one more quote:</p><blockquote><p>All new fusionists see the welfare state as the motor of dysgenesis. The reason for this is threefold. First, it operates on the principle of equality of outcomes as well as of starting points, an unrealistic goal in a world of deeply divergent human capabilities. Second, it institutionalizes incentives that subsidize the multiplication of the mentally inferior; those unable or unwilling to find gainful employment are (supposedly) rewarded for reproduction through child benefits. Third, the provisions of the social state act as a magnet for similarly low-intelligence immigrants from populations that are already below average white intelligence, namely, all nonwhite and non-Asian populations. The attraction of low-intelligence immigrants is a special problem as all three thinkers share the conviction that economic structural change is making intelligence more important than ever.</p></blockquote><p>So, genetic data has <strong>some</strong> real value. In and of itself, genetic data doesn&#8217;t seem capable of consistently yielding gold for the firms dedicated to mining it. But it offers the ability to bolster existing regimes of extraction (advertising, insurance, behavior modification, etc.) and the promise of the great white hope that someday, somehow, we will re-legitimize the <em>ancien r&#233;gime</em>. God willing, these efforts will see the same fate as that old system.</p>]]>

Let me explain.</p><p>Yes, this stuff is an &#8220;insult to art itself&#8221; as Brian Merchant <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-159951160">points out</a> in his invocation of Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki&#8217;s earlier comments on early AI art tools (&#8220;I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself&#8221;). Firms hawking generative AI powered are dead-set on eviscerating legal barriers obstructing their god-given right to "ingest copyrighted works into their training data" and will vomit up any answer that resembles something reasonable&#8212;much like their products. If you do not let us do this, China will surpass us is an increasingly popular and successful one. </p><p>As a result, artists are left shit out of luck. As Merchant writes:</p><blockquote><p>OpenAI and the other AI giants are indeed eating away at the livelihoods and dignity of working artists, and this devouring, appropriating, and automation of the production of art, of culture, at a scale truly never seen before, should not be underestimated as a menace&#8212;and it is being experienced as such by working artists, right now.</p></blockquote><p>On top of the exploitation of artists and their livelihood, we get to consider what this does to our role in cultural production. How does being flooded with slop that <em>does not but does</em> resemble significant cultural products&#8212;because it is superficially trained off the form of various works of art, as well as those inspired by or derived from it, as well as commentary about it&#8212;affect our own internal response to those same pieces of art, even when presented in their original slop-free context?</p><p>Erik Hoel <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-159983195">chimes in here</a>, warning we are entering "the semantic apocalypse" or following down the path of "semantic satiation" whereby a word loses meaning if it is said over and over and over and over and over again:</p><blockquote><p>The semantic apocalypse heralded by AI is a kind of semantic satiation at a <em>cultural</em> level. For imitation, which is what these models ultimately do best, is a form of repetition. Repetition at a mass scale. Ghibli. Ghibli. Ghibli. Repetition close enough in concept space. Ghibli. Ghibli. Doesn&#8217;t have to be a perfect copy to trigger the effect. Ghebli. Ghebli. Ghebli. Ghibli. Ghebli. Ghibli. And so art&#8212;all of it, I mean, the entire human artistic endeavor&#8212;becomes a thing satiated, stripped of meaning, pure syntax.</p><p>This is what I fear most about AI, at least in the immediate future. Not some superintelligence that eats the world (it can&#8217;t even <a href="https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/ai-plays-pokemon-but-so-does-teslas">beat Pok&#233;mon</a> yet, a game many of us conquered at ten). Rather, a less noticeable apocalypse. Culture following the same collapse as community on the back of a whirring compute surplus of imitative power provided by Silicon Valley. An oversupply that satiates us at a cultural level, until we become divorced from the semantic meaning and see only the cheap bones of its structure. Once exposed, it&#8217;s a thing you have no relation to, really. Just pixels. Just syllables. In some order, yes. But who cares?</p></blockquote><p>So on the cultural front it is pretty bleak. AI firms are creating tools that will be used to produce <em>good enough</em> AI slop&#8212;stuff that&#8217;s eerily reminiscent of cultural works we&#8217;re inspired by or fond of. Cultural works and products that are stolen to fill datasets to train LLMs will be slowly sapped of meaning and value, thanks to how easy the slop is to produce and how well-capitalized its producers are. </p><p>I agree with <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-160035560?source=queue">Max Read&#8217;s take</a> that it's "hard to be exercised over something so obviously ephemeral" but, as he points out, this is symptomatic of a larger debate: the emotional weight and reputation of Miyazaki's and Studio Ghibli's craft that excites AI shills generating these images who insist it&#8217;s democratizing creativity, at the same time frustrating critics who treasure what that art represents but also are (rightfully) skeptical of promises by the tech sector that a new technology will democratize something. </p><p>To take one small example: <a href="https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/facpub/1728/">fintech</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-17/crypto-got-what-it-wanted-in-the-us-election-here-s-what-s-next?srnd=undefined">crypto</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/charts/top">web3</a> have all been hailed as the future and have made similar promises about democratizing hard-to-enter spaces to the benefit of all. They have all amounted to little more than schemes of varying complexity to steal from investors, defraud the public, undermine consumer protections that declare a certain avenue of profit-seeking as illegal (and immoral), and use this wealth transfer to legitimize parasitic enterprises that should not exist. </p><p>Going back to Read, he builds on Merchant's essay last week with a 1935 essay from Walter Benjamin "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" that reflects on how implementing technical tools to accelerate the production of art robs us of something of its essence:</p><blockquote><p>A.I., one could argue, enacts on particular artistic <em>styles</em> what photography and lithography enacted on particular works of painting or sculpture, rendering those styles endlessly reproducible, de-aura-fied, no longer subject to the &#8220;criterion of authenticity&#8221; from which they previously derived value.</p><p>But (without necessarily wanting to endorse this argument re: A.I. and style) we might also note that Benjamin&#8217;s main point was not so much to endlessly bemoan the withering of aura but to explore the effects of mechanical reproduction on the &#8220;social function&#8221; of art.<a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-160035560?source=queue#footnote-4-160035560"><sup>4</sup></a> The toothpaste is kind of out of the tube on this one, in Benjamin&#8217;s time as in ours, and there are reasons to welcome the freeing of art from its &#8220;parasitic subservience to ritual.&#8221; When art can no longer automatically obtain significance from ritual--authenticity, tradition, or even ownership--its value must be found elsewhere. &#8220;Instead of being founded on ritual,&#8221; he writes, the social function of art &#8220;is based on a different practice: politics.&#8221; What matters with art isn&#8217;t its past (where and who it comes from), but its future: what it does.</p></blockquote><p>And as Read remarks, this leads us to the question: what are the politics of AI slop/art? Read quotes Benjamin&#8217;s essay and drives home the point that it is fascism which "sees its salvation in granting expression to the masses&#8212;but on no account granting them rights" and means "self-alienation has reached the point where it can experience its own annihilation as a supreme aesthetic pleasure." This is all true and well, but the use of generative AI for images or writing is ultimately a distraction.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!buCe!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57996758-28b6-4624-98f1-500862448289_1536x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!buCe!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57996758-28b6-4624-98f1-500862448289_1536x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!buCe!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57996758-28b6-4624-98f1-500862448289_1536x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!buCe!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57996758-28b6-4624-98f1-500862448289_1536x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!buCe!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57996758-28b6-4624-98f1-500862448289_1536x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!buCe!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57996758-28b6-4624-98f1-500862448289_1536x1024.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/57996758-28b6-4624-98f1-500862448289_1536x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:812121,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/i/160078748?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57996758-28b6-4624-98f1-500862448289_1536x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!buCe!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57996758-28b6-4624-98f1-500862448289_1536x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!buCe!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57996758-28b6-4624-98f1-500862448289_1536x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!buCe!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57996758-28b6-4624-98f1-500862448289_1536x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!buCe!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F57996758-28b6-4624-98f1-500862448289_1536x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg

It replaces workers, devours millions of gallons of water, vomits CO2 into the atmosphere, propagandises exclusively for the worst ideologies, and fills the world with more ugliness and stupidity. Cruelty is the central tenet of right wing ideology. It is at the heart of everything they do. They are now quite willing to lose money or their lives in order to make the world a crueller place, and AI is a part of this &#8211; a mad rush to make a machine god that will liberate capital from labour for good. (This is no exaggeration: there is a lineage from OpenAI&#8217;s senior management back to the Lesswrong blog, originator of the concept of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rokos-basilisk">Roko&#8217;s Basilisk</a>.) Moreso even than cryptocurrency, AI is entirely nihilistic, with zero redeeming qualities. It is a blight upon the world, and it will take decades to clear up the mountains of slop it has generated in the past two or three years.</p></blockquote><p>AI Art should be thought of as a trojan horse. There is much more interest and excitement in using artificial intelligence to predict human behavior, surveil groups of people, using behavioral insights to improve discrimination, synthesize and securitize new assets, innovate new forms of dispossession and extraction, terrorize migrants and dissidents, regiment work and disempower workers, and a host of other noxious deleterious social ends. Another place to turn to when thinking about this is Dan McQuillan's book <em>Resisting AI: An Anti-fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence</em>:</p><blockquote><p>The struggle against the fascization of AI precedes AI itself. It&#8217;s not that AI first comes into existence and we then have to tackle its dodgy politics from scratch, but rather that AI is already part of the system&#8217;s ongoing violent response to the autonomous activity of ordinary people. Instead of having to invent a plethora of new remedial measures, we can build on the long history of community solidarity generated by people&#8217;s resistance to exclusion and enclosure.</p><p>The very generalizability of AI and the way it comes to bear on different communities and constituencies creates the potential for this resistance to cut across race, gender, sexuality, disability and other forms of demographic division. If the whole of society becomes subsumed by algorithmically ordered relations and enrolled in machinic optimization, then society as a whole also becomes a site for contesting the imposition of those power relations. AI&#8217;s generalizability and its intensification of social crisis creates a position from which to question the totality of social relations.</p></blockquote><p>So does OpenAI&#8217;s marketing stunt matter? That&#8217;s probably the wrong way to think about it. AI firms are interested in developing tools and marketing strategies that <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/general/ai-generated-business">revolve around the allure of AGI</a>&#8212;around <a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/trapped-in-the-maw-of-a-stillborn">a stillborn god</a> that will transform large swaths of society into excessively profitable enterprises and incredibly efficient operations. Think of it as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/opinion/artificial-intelligence-danger.html">desperate attempt to defend capitalism</a>, to preserve the status quo (capitalism) while purging recent reforms that purportedly undermine it (democracy, liberalism, feminism, environmentalism, etc.). Sam Altman, OpenAI&#8217;s co-founder, has repeatedly called for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-07-12/sam-altman-sees-need-for-a-new-social-contract-video">&#8220;a new social contract,&#8221;</a> though most recently has insisted the &#8220;AI revolution&#8221; will <a href="https://moores.samaltman.com/">force the issue</a> on account of <a href="https://aiforgood.itu.int/ai-and-the-social-contract-how-sam-altman-envisions-tomorrows-world/">&#8220;how powerful we expect [AGI] to be.&#8221;</a> It doesn&#8217;t take much to imagine that the new social contract will be a nightmarish exterminist future where AI powers surveillance, discipline, control, and extraction, instead of &#8220;value creation&#8221; for the whole of humanity.</p><p>The subsuming of art springs out of the defense of capitalism&#8212;more and more will have to be scavenged and cannibalized to sustain the status quo and somehow, someday, realize this supposedly much more profitable horizon. The ascendance of fascism comes with the purge&#8212;the attempt to rollback institutions and victories seen as shackles on the ability of capitalism to deliver prosperity (and limiters on the inordinate power and privilege for an unimaginably pampered and cloistered elite). </p><p>Both are part and parcel to what&#8217;s going on, but one project is objectively more dangerous (and ambitious) than the other.

Pay no mind to the unmarked vans and plainclothes officers, the censorship and disappearances, the mass deportations or drone assassinations, the civilian assassinations or ongoing genocides.

By taking in as much information as possible through pervasive surveillance and give as little information as possible, the hope is that you can create information asymmetries that give you the power to set fares and compensation at optimal levels (maximal and minimal, respectively). Veena Dubal, one of the authors of this Fairwork report, has called this <a href="https://www.columbialawreview.org/content/on-algorithmic-wage-discrimination/">algorithmic wage discrimination</a> (also cited above). In an LPE Project blog post <a href="https://lpeproject.org/blog/the-house-always-wins-the-algorithmic-gamblification-of-work/">introducing the concept</a>, Dubal writes: </p><blockquote><p>As a labor management practice, algorithmic wage discrimination allows firms to personalize and differentiate wages for workers in ways unknown to them, paying them to behave in ways that the firm desires, perhaps for as little as the system determines that they may be willing to accept. Given the information asymmetry between workers and the firm, companies can calculate the exact wage rates necessary to incentivize desired behaviors, while workers can only guess as to why they make what they do.</p><p>In addition to being rife with mistakes that are difficult or impossible for workers to ascertain and correct, algorithmic wage discrimination creates a labor market in which people who are doing the same work, with the same skill, for the same company, at the same time, may receive different hourly pay. Moreover, this personalized wage is determined through an obscure, complex system that makes it nearly impossible for workers to predict or understand their frequently declining compensation.</p></blockquote><p>You cannot understand the extent to which on-demand labor is exploitative, dehumanizing, disruptive, unpredictable, and immiserating until you appreciate the extent to which it is managed by black-box algorithms primed to extract as much as possible&#8212;and how big of a boon this has been for firms which were previously unable to achieve profits except through accounting tricks.</p><h2>Editorial</h2><p>Algorithmic overseers are not only deployed to extract as much from both ends of a transaction, but to flense as much off cost structures as possible. Scheduling, payment processing, paperwork, notifications, customer service, HR, Q&amp;A, and more are all being eliminated or consolidated or automated under the pretense of algorithmic efficiency. When these systems fail, as they constantly do, you&#8217;re left with a chatbot to handle your complaints and queries.</p><blockquote><p>The new algorithmic management technologies have direct implications for operational cost-cutting, efficiency metrics across the supply chains, and measurable KPIs (key performance indicators). This hyper-quantification of work can expedite decision-making, scaling, and meeting the performance indicators set by investors and funders. However, the implications for work that has been re-structured and re-imagined through these technologies are far reaching for workers, consumers, and societies. Automated technologies are displacing traditional management relationships, transparency, and accountability in the workplace. The data that platform workers produce may shape how platform companies set prices, manage workers, create personalised pay structures, and even offset financial liabilities. Indeed, one company named Argyle has amassed the employment records of 40 million platform workers in the US, and sells this data as its primary source of profits. The reality of working with AI is different from the promises associated with it. AI is, to put it descriptively, eating the managers.</p></blockquote><p>To that end, the report looks at 11 on-demand platforms across ride-hail, food delivery, elder care, and healthcare to see what the impact of these algorithmic overseer technologies is shaping out to be. Are they replacing managers? Are they creating new management practices and institutions? Are they allowing these firms to develop new relations with consumers, workers, other companies, or governments? And, most important, what are they doing to our notions of work and fairness. </p><p>Fairwork's report looks at 11 platforms (CareRev, Clipboard Health, Doordash, Grubhub, Instacart, Lyft, Papa, ShiftKey, ShiftMed, Uber, and Ubereats) in the United States. They&#8217;re assessed on a 10 point scoring system that evaluates working conditions according to five principles: </p><blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Fair Pay</strong>: Workers, irrespective of their employment classification, should earn a decent income in their home jurisdiction after taking account of work-related costs.

One scored one point, another scored two points. This is abysmal but unsurprising given the aggression with which these companies pursue profits illegally and immorally.</p><h2>Key Findings</h2><h3>FAIR PAY</h3><p>Fairwork found that only <strong>one</strong> company (ShiftMed) out of the 11 studied paid its workers a minimum wage. Why? ShiftMed is the only firm to classify workers as employees, which protects them under federal labor laws and provides some basic guarantees about working conditions and compensation. Every other company, however, classifies workers as independent contractors who:</p><blockquote><p>are responsible for significant work-related costs and spend parts of their workdays engaged in unpaid activities, such as driving long-distances to get to a shift or waiting for a customer to receive an order.</p></blockquote><p>One thing to understand about substandard wages is that they&#8217;re a great anti-competitive strategy and were understood as such back when the Fair Labor Standards Act (which establishes standards for minimum wages, overtime pay, and youth employment) was passed in 1938. As Eamon Coburn <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/supply-chain-wage-theft-as-unfair-method-of-competition">writes</a> in <em>Yale Law Review</em>:</p><blockquote><p>These concerns animated early minimum-wage advocates who expressed two theories of substandard wages as unfair competition: substandard wages as competition by subversion of public norms, and substandard wages as taking an implicit subsidy from workers and the public. In the 1930s, political, business, and labor leaders continued to frame labor abuses as a competition problem throughout the consideration and implementation of national wage-and-hour legislation, repeating both of these theories to justify federal action.</p></blockquote><p>The first theory sees substandard wages as a violation of public standards around living wages or industry norms, allowing a firm outcompete others on prices by reducing (labor) costs. Firms like Uber might respond to this by saying&#8212;as they have in the past&#8212;that adhering to public norms <a href="https://www.amny.com/nyc-transit/uber-threat-layoffs-drivers-nyc-minimum-pay/">would make their service too expensive</a> and rob the public of its benefits. Little over a century ago, this was understood as such an immoral response that you had radicals like President Theodore Roosevelt saying: "We will not submit to that kind of prosperity any more than we will submit to prosperity obtained by swindling investors or getting unfair advantages over business rivals."</p><p>The second theory, Coburn writes, sees substandard wages as a way for firms to "pad their bottom line with money owed to workers and gain the full benefit of their employees' productivity while shouldering only part of the cost." This also manifests as a tax burden shouldered by other firms as workers paid substandard wages then rely on social programs that their employers won&#8217;t pay into. Uber and Lyft have long been the gig economy&#8217;s vanguard here, using worker misclassification to <a href="https://slate.com/business/2024/05/uber-lyft-gig-economy-driver-classification-business-taxes-unemployment.html">avoid paying hundreds of millions of dollars in unemployment taxes, workers&#8217; compensation, and paid family and medical leave insurance</a>&#8212;undermining the social safety net <strong>and</strong> pushing up tax rates for other firms.</p><p>To make their unit economics work, on-demand labor platforms need to embrace anti-competitive strategies in hopes of attracting enough capital, customers, and political power to reforge relevant markets into forms more able to generate and sustain profits: price-gouging customers and underpaying (and misclassifying) workers are <strong>key</strong>.</p><h3>FAIR CONDITIONS</h3><p>Unsurprisingly, each of these firms all trade in horrific work conditions.</p><blockquote><p>Fairwork was unable to fi nd suffi cient evidence to award a point to any of the platforms in this study. Workers report signifi cant task-specifi c risks and lack of a safety net.</p><p>Across 11 of the largest on-demand labour platforms in the US, workers reported physical assaults, verbal abuse and stressful working conditions. Fairwork finds that safety is a major issue for on-demand nursing companies, on-demand elderly care companies, on-demand delivery companies, and on-demand ride-hail companies. In healthcare, significant changes are needed to orient, train, and manage on-demand workers so that they can protect both themselves and their patients.</p></blockquote><p>The gig economy is, out of necessity, built on a business model that necessitates worker misclassification. Again, they are seeking profits and returns that are locked behind rules and regulations aimed at protecting workers. Both cursory glances and in-depth examinations quickly make this feature painfully clear.</p><p>In 2022, a national survey of gig workers by the Economic Policy Institute <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/gig-worker-survey/">painted a bleak picture</a>:</p><ul><li><p>19 percent of gig workers went hungry because they couldn't afford enough to eat (compared to 14 percent of service sector employees)</p></li><li><p>31 percent didn't have earn enough to pay their utility bills (vs. 17 percent of service sector employees)</p></li><li><p>18 percent lived in a household where someone didn't seek medical care in the last month because of the cost (vs. 13 percent of service sector employees)</p></li><li><p>30 percent used SNAP (vs. 15 percent of service sector employees)</p></li></ul><p>In 2021, <em>The Verge</em> and <em>New York </em>Magazine <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps">collaborated on an investigative report </a>looking at New York City&#8217;s 65,000 delivery workers who were left to fend for themselves by the apps that exploited and misclassified them, as well as a city that seemed uninterested in their safety or livelihoods, forcing them to gerry-rig solutions themselves:</p><blockquote><p>Workers developed the whole system &#8212; the bikes, repair networks, shelters, charging stations &#8212; because they had to. To the apps, they are independent contractors; to restaurants, they are emissaries of the apps; to customers, they represent the restaurants. In reality, the workers are on their own, often without even the minimum in government support. As contractors and, often, undocumented immigrants, they have few protections and virtually no safety net. The few times city authorities noted the delivery worker&#8217;s changing role, it was typically with confused hostility. Until recently, throttle-powered electric bikes like the Arrow were illegal to ride, though not to own. Mayor de Blasio heightened enforcement in 2017, calling the bikes &#8220;a real danger&#8221; after an Upper West Side investment banker clocked workers with a speed gun and complained to him on <em>The Brian Lehrer Show</em>.</p><p>The NYPD set up checkpoints, fining riders $500, seizing their bikes, and posting photos of the busts on Twitter. The police would then return the bikes because, again, they were legal to own. It was a costly and bewildering ritual. For years, bike activists and workers pushed for legalization, though the apps that benefited from them were largely silent. It was only when another group of tech companies &#8212; hoping to make scooter-sharing legal &#8212; joined the fight that a bill moved forward in Albany. Then the pandemic hit, restaurants were restricted to takeout, and the mayor had to acknowledge that the bikes were an essential part of the city&#8217;s delivery infrastructure. He halted enforcement. The bikes were officially legalized three months later.</p></blockquote><p> In 2022, the Markup <a href="https://themarkup.org/working-for-an-algorithm/2022/07/28/more-than-350-gig-workers-carjacked-28-killed-over-the-last-five-years">reported</a> it had independently tracked a total of 361 ride-hail and delivery drivers who'd been victims of attempted and successful carjackings since 2017&#8212;28 drivers had been killed as a result. That number was likely much higher though. Uber revealed that year there were at least 24,000 "safety incident reports" from 2017 to 2020 that involved a passenger physically assaulting a driver, but specifics were declared confidental and kept under seal:</p><blockquote><p>Our data isn&#8217;t comprehensive, however. Most police departments don&#8217;t gather statistics on carjackings specifically against gig workers, and the gig companies have repeatedly declined to provide their own data on carjackings. The Markup compiled its database through police reports and local news articles that cite police reports, and by conducting interviews with drivers, family members, and lawyers representing drivers (or their families) who were victims of carjackings.</p></blockquote><p>As I&#8217;ve written over the years, Uber and Lyft have repeatedly seen driver shortages at key moments despite incentives that make the pay livable because the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/uber-and-lyft-cant-find-drivers-because-gig-work-sucks/">working conditions are intolerable </a>for most drivers!</p><h3>FAIR CONTRACTS</h3><p>Contracts do not fare any better among the platforms:</p><blockquote><p>Two of the evaluated platforms &#8211; ShiftMed and Papa &#8211; have clear and accessible terms and conditions. But the widespread use of liability clauses on the platforms included in this year&#8217;s study place nearly all the risk of negligence on workers rather than companies.</p><p>Ethical and responsible data protection measures for worker data are needed for the 11 platforms in this study, and more transparency and accountability are needed for workers to understand how their data is collected, processed and stored. Fairwork finds that class action waivers and arbitration clauses are commonly used, and they limit workers&#8217; ability to bring legal claims collectively or have their cases decided by a court of law.</p></blockquote><p>For years, gig companies have pushed for mandatory arbitration because it is incredibly good at stymying class action lawsuits and legal precedents&#8212;again, if your business model relies on skirting the law, regulatory arbitrage, and aggressive lobbying, you need to stop angry workers in deplorable conditions from collectively demanding the right to earn a livable wage or be safe in the course of their work or get health insurance or other indications of dignified work. </p><p>Uber and Lyft recently said as much when they <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/column-uber-lyft-ask-us-supreme-court-block-state-officials-skirting-arbitration-2024-04-22/">asked the Supreme Court in 2024</a> to block state officials from using their enforcement powers to seek money for workers and customers who've signed the companies' mandatory arbitration agreements.</p><blockquote><p>Technically, the companies want the justices to review a 2023 California state court appellate <a href="https://tmsnrt.rs/4aHwLtW">ruling, opens new tab</a> that allowed California&#8217;s attorney general and labor commissioner to continue litigating claims that Uber and Lyft owe money to drivers who were misclassified as independent contractors. They contend that the California Court of Appeal &#8211; like state appellate courts in five other states &#8211; misread a key 2002 Supreme Court decision when it concluded that state officials are not bound by workers&#8217; arbitration agreements.</p><p>But make no mistake: The theory espoused by Uber and Lyft would preclude all kinds of litigation by states attorneys general, from consumer protection and unfair competition litigation to antidiscrimination suits. If Uber and Lyft are right, state AGs and other officials simply would not be permitted to bring lawsuits seeking monetary relief for anyone who signed an arbitration agreement.</p><p>The companies said as much in their petitions, arguing that in response to Supreme Court decisions allowing companies to impose mandatory arbitration on workers and consumers, states have become increasingly likely to adopt &#8220;creative devices,&#8221; in the words of Lyft&#8217;s lawyers from Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson, to undermine arbitration. And unless the Supreme Court steps in, Uber and Lyft said, state officials will continue to expand such loopholes until the Federal Arbitration Act is effectively nullified.</p></blockquote><p>The cases in question that Uber and Lyft are petitioning trace back to a 2020 San Francisco state court case "seeking (among other relief) unpaid wages and benefits for allegedly misclassified drivers" and argues that because drivers waived their rights when signing these contracts, whether or not they read them closely, the state's officials cannot weigh in. And the success that Uber and Lyft have enjoyed with blocking drivers from costly class action lawsuit over wage theft, misclassification, liability for injuries or death, and so on have inspired others across the gig economy to <a href="https://thearbitrationbrief.com/2024/06/22/silencing-gig-workers-arbitration-and-misclassification-in-the-gig-economy/">emulate the forced arbitration strategy</a>. As Jacqueline Vanacore of Washington College of Law's Arbitration Brief lays out  in 2024:</p><blockquote><p>The substantial damage awards won by workers who litigated misclassification claims laid the groundwork for employers&#8217; burgeoning preference for mandatory arbitration agreements and class action waivers<strong>. </strong>In <em><a href="https://casetext.com/case/estrada-v-fedex-ground">Estrada v. FedEx</a>, </em>a California Appeals Court held that FedEx drivers are employees instead of ICs because FedEx maintained control over drivers by requiring them to pay for business expenses such as uniforms, fuel, insurance, and truck maintenance. <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/insight-misclassifying-employees-making-a-mistake-can-be-costly">The workers were awarded</a> $14 million in damages from 2005-2008 and $12 million in legal fees. Moreover, in 2014, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/06/16/fedex-settles-driver-mislabeling-case-for-228-million/?sh=3e677edc22ed">Ninth Circuit</a> held that FedEx drivers were misclassified as ICs and were <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2015/06/12/fedex-settlement-drivers-independent-contractors.html">owed back wages</a> for missed meals, breaks, and overtime and were entitled to worker&#8217;s compensation and unemployment insurance. FedEx settled the class action dispute with over 2,000 drivers for <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2015/06/12/fedex-settlement-drivers-independent-contractors.html">$228 million</a>.</p><p>The FedEx cases illustrate the financial risk of <a href="https://niwr.org/2021/08/11/no-due-process-no-rights/#_ftn8">misclassification lawsuits</a> to <a href="https://niwr.org/2021/08/11/no-due-process-no-rights/#_ftn3">Gig employers</a>, whose workforce mainly consists of ICs. Although arbitration can attempt to address individual employment misclassification, the broader problem of misclassification for an entire workforce will persist. The <a href="https://niwr.org/2021/08/11/no-due-process-no-rights/#_ftn8">outcome</a> of private arbitrations is secret, non-precedential, and only applies to a small group or an individual worker. <a href="https://niwr.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Taking-Forced-Out-Of-Arbitration_English_Final.pdf">Statistics</a> demonstrate that arbitrators who frequently rule in favor of an employer are more likely to be hired to resolve future employment disputes. Misclassification claims brought to arbitration will likely have a <a href="https://niwr.org/2021/08/11/no-due-process-no-rights/#_ftn8">low dollar value</a>, especially when workers are prohibited from filing a class action or must <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/forced-is-never-fair-what-labor-arbitration-teaches-us-about-arbitration-done-right-and-wrong/">represent themselves</a> in arbitration. An <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EyaeR1ZWwxLTYxMw_OpLLK6Ml7YYR-LR/view?usp=sharing">Uber driver</a> who represented herself in arbitration received only $4,000 backpay for reimbursed expenses. The decision resulted in significant financial savings for Uber but <a href="https://legal-forum.uchicago.edu/print-archive/disrupting-work-law-arbitration-gig-economy">inadequate compensation</a> or justice for the worker.</p></blockquote><p>It is a win-win situation for the firm, freeing it of the costs (fiscally and reputationally) of a court battle by disaggregating claimants, preserving misclassification, and insulating itself from laws and regulations it&#8217;s running afoul of elsewhere.</p><h3>FAIR MANAGEMENT</h3><p>As I&#8217;ve talked about above, algorithmic overseers are central to the gig economy business model&#8212;in fact, here and elsewhere in the world of algorithmically mediated labor, I&#8217;ve <a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/ai-slavery-surveillance-and-capitalism">argued</a> plantation logic is integral to disciplining and controlling a workforce that is both &#8220;independent&#8221; but persistently surveilled and highly regimented/structured/guided with insights gleaned from digital tools. </p><p>Fairwork&#8217;s assessment: </p><blockquote><p>Fairwork was unable to award a score for this principle to any of the assessed platforms. We were unable to find sufficient evidence of a due process for decisions affecting workers. </p><p>Improvements are needed for workers to meaningfully appeal low ratings, report issues of non-payment, late-payment, deactivations, other penalties, and disciplinary actions. Although many of the platforms offer public statements in support of equality, diversity and non-discrimination, more evidence is needed to confirm that these policies are put in practice.</p></blockquote><p>The deployment of algorithmic overseers that helps force on-demand workers to accept <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gig-workers-algorithm-downranked/">unfair and unchallengeable firings</a> and <a href="https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/data-algorithms-at-work/">dehumanizing work conditions</a>. There are a litany of second-order consequences, but it&#8217;s important to keep in mind just how destabilizing algorithmic management is <strong>to the worker</strong>. Zephyr Teachout echo&#8217;s Dubal&#8217;s concerns in another article on the ascent of algorithmically targeted wages:</p><blockquote><p>Algorithmic management also transforms the nature of supervision, and the power and sentimental relationships between supervisors and mid-level decisionmakers and locates the decision-making in a combination of the upper-level management and the results of hyperindividualized tools that rely on spying and psychological updating. Not only do the direct supervisors have little power, but the workers are then employed in a state of rational paranoia, where they know that they are being punished and rewarded and experimented upon, but they have no way of knowing whether any given decision they are faced with is a result of a game, an experiment, a punishment, or reward, or changing circumstances on the ground and changing needs at the job.</p></blockquote><p>Such insecurity is necessary for highly personalized wages to work, as is an extensive surveillance apparatus that arbitrarily savages workers. It also encroaches on privacy concerns, in deep and under-appreciated ways that will come for all of us eventually. As Teachout goes on to write:</p><blockquote><p>The right to privacy in one&#8217;s thoughts and actions is fundamental, a basic right that implements the democratic commitment to human dignity. Privacy implicates the right of people to have control over the boundaries of what is known about them&#8212;both what they want to protect from view, and what they want to project in the public arena. While employers have always supervised and monitored and&#8212;since the 1990s&#8212;recorded an enormous amount of data about employees, the opportunity to collect data that allows for targeted wages increases the incentive to monitor substantially, and the opportunity to collect data that allows for experimentation and extreme Taylorism does the same.</p><p>Therefore, the privacy concerns which have long attended the workplace&#8212;and never been adequately addressed&#8212;move from second order concerns to first order concerns as the scope of monitoring increases, and the arenas which are monitored move from the superficial to the intimate. As Michael Selmi has argued, privacy constitutes the person, and while &#8220;it is one thing to give an employer broad dominion over its own workplace, but it is quite another to extend that dominion wherever the employee goes.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>As Teachout, Dubal, and Sarah Jaffe also remind us&#8212;these tools of surveillance, control, domination, privacy violation, and algorithmic discrimination find earliest adoption and persistent experimentation in industries dominated by Black and brown workers&#8212;such as care work, ride-hail, and food delivery. Plantation logic through and through: we can return to older levels of extraction in modern non-white workforces by making the (digital) factory resemble the plantation with discipline, control, the treat of starvation, piece-pay, and a persistent commitment to dehumanization.</p><h3>FAIR REPRESENTATION</h3><p>Fairwork&#8217;s assessment:</p><blockquote><p>Collective organisation and representation is a fundamental right for workers and employees. Fairwork was unable to evidence that the 11 platforms in this study assure freedom of association or expression of worker voice in line with the Fairwork Fair Representation principle thresholds. </p><p>As shown in the report, various models of contracting labour are used by digital labour platforms; these can either hinder or enable workers to act on their right to collectively organise. We were unable to evidence that the 11 platforms in this study assure freedom of association or the expression of worker voice in line with the Fairwork Fair Representation principle thresholds.</p></blockquote><p>All of the elements I&#8217;ve discussed conspire to disempower workers at every possible turn. It is pretty hard to have solidarity, let alone representation, if your employer has deployed an impressive technology stack aimed at preserving your precarity with personalized starvation wages, pervasive surveillance, a lack of privacy, or arbitrary firings and punishments. Worker solidarity groups do emerge despite all of this but, as I write above, many of those groups (necessarily so) spend their energy ameliorating how unsafe and how extractive this line of work is. That is: helping bring down operating costs that the company dumps on them (bikes, scooters, cars, fuel, weather gear, maintenance of equipment, etc.), retrieving stolen equipment when cops don&#8217;t help (which is most of the time), doing patrols to deter attacks on delivery workers, and so on. Successful union drives are far and few between despite constant valiant efforts made to organize workers, take over company facilities, partner with legal advocates to push back against gig economy lobbyists, and work with lawmakers to push through pro-worker legislation. </p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">The Tech Bubble is a reader-supported publication.

There are three strategies at play here:</p><h4>Step 1: Ignoring the law</h4><p>A fundamental element of the on-demand business model. Ignoring the law doesn't only allow firms to roll back the clock on labor laws in hopes of realizing profits that are otherwise illegal, but by insisting the law itself is outdated&#8212;it wasn&#8217;t made with The Digital Economy in mind. As Fairwork&#8217;s researchers write:</p><blockquote><p>In this phase, the rule of law is secondary to the holy aura of innovation. To advance this worldview and to subvert governance structures, labour platforms exploit real problems caused by years of austerity, from decaying public transit infrastructure and neighborhood disinvestments to struggling social services and wage stagnation. Platform firms argue that they, rather than a recalcitrant government or any of its under-resourced programmes, should be at the center of solutions. When Obama&#8217;s 2008 campaign manager and White House senior advisor, David Plouffe, joined Uber as its new senior vice president for policy and strategy, Plouffe said Uber would help workers put money &#8220;back in their pocket&#8221; and receive the &#8220;pay raise that they&#8217;ve been denied for years.&#8221; At the same time, he offered assurances that the company was self-reliant. &#8220;We are not asking for special tax breaks like those who want to build a factory or headquarters in a city often do.&#8221; Legal precedents and government institutions, Plouffe suggested, were an impediment to progress, not evidence of it. Other platforms have mimicked these Silicon Valley ideas about how change happens &#8211; with powerful outsiders &#8211; and followed suit with their own arguments against regulation as a common good.</p></blockquote><h4>Step 2: Securing permanent exemptions by rewriting local and state laws</h4><p>As Fairwork writes:</p><blockquote><p>One of Uber&#8217;s greatest innovations is its argument that technologically-mediated business models are so unique that they merit brand new business categories. What&#8217;s so important about having a new business category? The new categories are the very tool that helps platforms win carve-outs from existing rules. After Uber or DoorDash convince policymakers that they deserve their own category, the platforms then argue that they should operate wholly free of government interference or any standing regulatory body. To wiggle themselves out of this public oversight, labour platforms draw on campaign language that is eerily similar to the Koch brothers&#8217; deregulatory efforts in the 1990s, and the contemporary efforts of groups like the ultraconservative American Legislative Exchange Council. In this phase, platform companies act as &#8220;regulatory entrepreneurs,&#8221; companies for which rewriting laws, as opposed to simply currying favor through traditional lobbying, is a significant part of their development plans.</p></blockquote><p>That wildly successful strategy has already started to see action with on-demand care workers, with firms arguing that "Digitally-dispatched healthcare workers" and their employers should be exempt from local and state laws much like Uber's legal category of "Transportation Network Company" allowed the firm to flirt established regulations in place for ride-hail dispatch operators that did not operate through an app. For nurses and nursing assistants, this would mean any worker deployed through an app or website would be misclassified as an independent contractor&#8212;a move that, again, removes the host of protections and guarantees getting in the way of profitability for these firms.</p><blockquote><p>In this phase, if a platform meets city-level resistance in these category-making efforts, the platform turns to state preemption &#8211; the nullification of municipal ordinances by state legislatures. Since 2017, Uber and its peers have pressured 34 state legislatures to prohibit governments at the city and county level from setting labour standards such as a minimum wage, raising tax revenues on ridehailing services, or mandating safety or accessibility measures. Hawaii&#8217;s law, for instance, preempts &#8220;any ordinance or other regulation adopted by a political subdivision that specifically governs transportation network companies, transportation network company drivers, or transportation network company vehicles.&#8221; An economic development expert pointed out the irony of these state-level interventions: <em><strong>&#8220;I frankly think it&#8217;s hypocritical of Uber and Lyft to say &#8216;We are partners of cities&#8217; while systematically undermining the ability of their elected officials to actually manage how these services fit into the milieu.&#8221;</strong></em></p></blockquote><h4>Step 3: Embrace government and institutional partnerships</h4><blockquote><p>In this phase, platforms from Uber and DoorDash to Instacart and Papa secure partnerships with a host of institutions, from insurance providers and non-governmental social service providers to the federal government itself. Starting with Arizona in 2019, a handful of southern Republican states changed their laws to allow patients to use Medicaid funds to pay Uber and Lyft for rides to nonemergency medical appointments. In 2021 Joe Biden&#8217;s administration partnered with Uber to provide free rides to Covid-19 vaccination appointments and installed Seth Harris, who wrote an influential study about the benefits of Uber&#8217;s worker treatment, in a top labour position. Uber has also worked with traditional unions to legislate sectoral or industry-wide bargaining for rideshare drivers while exempting workers from established labour protections, like the right to strike. Last year, Uber issued $30 million to one of California&#8217;s largest single-funded PACs, while a partnership between Uber and the Minnesota Department of Human Services to provide transit for disabled and elderly residents, especially in rural areas, threatened to derail minimum wage campaigns in that state. After a decade of disregarding laws and deceiving policymakers, now the company is, as a spokesperson told Bloomberg, &#8220;pitching proposals to state legislators that add benefits while protecting flexibility.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>DoorDash has built partnerships with food banks, churches, Meals on Wheels, veteran non-profits, hundreds of anti-hunger organisations, and major grocery chains. Instacart has not only followed suit by emulating DoorDash's move to accept platforms or Uber's work with public transit agencies, but has gone even further: it enjoys partnerships with universities to back PR talking points with research it funds, as well as partnerships that go so far as to use public funding for stipends for Instacart groceries. Papa partners with Medicare Advantage plans that let public funds go to Papa, works with insurers like Allstate to provide itself as a benefit for employee plans, and partners with Uber to offer ride-hail for its workers and their clients.</p><p>What is wrong with gig firms choosing collaboration instead of antagonism? Well they aren&#8217;t. They&#8217;re still impoverishing their workers and subjugating them to starvation wages, eroding labor standards for people outside their industries that find inspiration in Silicon Valley&#8217;s fight for the right to exploit workers, and persisting as a public parasite on multiple fronts: </p><ul><li><p>they evade taxes that pay into our social safety net while pushing more of their workers onto it</p></li><li><p>they degrade the quality of public goods and services in cities they purport to partner with</p></li><li><p>they degrade the working conditions of employee and independent contractor working conditions outside of industries infected by gig economy logic</p></li><li><p>they introduce algorithmic governance tools that use surveillance to enthusiastically violate basic norms around privacy, fairness, dignity, and morality when it comes to worker agency and autonomy, prices, wages, and the boundary between our personal lives and our work lives</p></li><li><p>they consolidate market power and political power off a project that is explicitly aimed at starving and disempowering workers, price gouging consumers, and eviscerating obstacles to monopolies and the rents that come with them&#8212;whether that be public institutions, market competitors, or their workers&#8217; livelihoods</p></li></ul><p>Or, as Fairwork writes:</p><blockquote><p>Collectively, the past 15 years have seen a strategic move among Silicon Valley&#8217;s platforms and their relationships with government, institutions, and civic organisations. It is a shift from antagonism to collaboration. Platform partnerships can generate dependencies, help companies gain institutional legitimation, and secure market power.</p></blockquote><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">The Tech Bubble is a reader-supported publication.

SKIP AHEAD.</p><p>This is a top 5 movie ending for me and if I ever made a film, it would end similar to this though a little bloodier. The movie follows Joe Gideon, a choreographer, theater director, film director, and editor whose life disintegrates as he tries to balance his commitment to work, booze, sex, and family. This builds and builds until heart attacks put him in the hospital, spurring end-of-life dream sequences that culminate in this musical number featuring everyone in his life:</p><div id="youtube2-4XAQ4vFQEJo" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;4XAQ4vFQEJo&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4XAQ4vFQEJo?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><h2>Book(seller) of the week</h2><p>This is a two for one. Over the past two years, one of the biggest influences on the literature I've been reading has been Stephen E Andrews, a fiction writer who runs the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0HYhM4ijo8&amp;t=127s&amp;ab_channel=OutlawBookseller">Outlaw Bookseller Youtube channel</a>. Andrews is a bookseller with an encyclopedic knowledge of science fiction, fantasy, horror, crime fiction, and much more. I can count on one hand how many books in the last two genres I read before finding his channel. Check him out, he&#8217;s introduced me to some of my favorite authors and books as well as given new appreciation for genres and the various schools of writers within them and historical contexts for certain stories or turns. </p><p>Here are some videos of his I recommend starting with:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyb8UB1qxoM&amp;ab_channel=OutlawBookseller">The WORST of PHILIP K. DICK? Which books to avoid?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDeGSeJ4QO4&amp;ab_channel=OutlawBookseller">William S. Burroughs Trilogy: What to read before you tackle this</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLClUjyQA4BcaAlpEkZJWRBehHhQOqBifE">His fascinating series of video essays on key features of SF</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eImxSNlOEfA&amp;ab_channel=OutlawBookseller">The Most DISGUSTING &amp; REPULSIVE Aliens in Science Fiction!</a></p></li></ul><p>The reason this is a two for one, however, is that Andrews just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0HYhM4ijo8&amp;t=10s&amp;ab_channel=OutlawBookseller">released a video</a> on science fiction writer Christopher Priest, whose book &#8220;The Prestige&#8221; was adapted into a film by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. Andrews introduced me to Priest two years ago after a fascinating interview with him and has a series of videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLClUjyQA4BcYTTBtvUU3H-0YbOgIFgP1_">Priest&#8217;s career and work</a> (Priest died early last year). The most recent video is on one of Priest&#8217;s best book, &#8220;The Glamour.&#8221; </p><p>Hard to describe without ruining the magic but I&#8217;ll quote Andrews here:</p><blockquote><p>The big problem with &#8220;The Glamour&#8221; is that it's almost impossible to talk about without ruining the unique pleasures that lay within this landmark work. It recalls Wittgenstein's dictum that "Whereof one cannot speak, one must remain silent." [Early] Wittgenstein, of course, believed that all philosophical problems were merely problems of language and once we had solved the problems ("climbed the ladder") we would throw language away. But, suffice to say, that this is an utterly original and spellbinding narrative that also works as an homage to one of the great works of H.G. Wells, so it does have a science fiction precedent. </p><p>It's not a dry, dull book, it's a gripping metaphysical thriller that leaves both the most mind-bending hard SF and the twistiest Gordian knot locked room mysteries standing in the shade. If you read &#8220;The Glamour,&#8221; you will irresistibly sucked into the vortex of the book, a book whose mysteries, contradictions, and evidences push you to try and balance what Priest is giving you into something that makes sense.And it's his peerless ability to misdirect, wrong-foot, tantalize, and imply, that seduces you into solving the ambiguous core of the novel and turn it into something concrete. Opening the book awakens an obsessive hunger in the reader that leaves them unable to put it aside unless its enigmas are fully experienced.</p></blockquote><h2>Reading Recommendations</h2><p>Last week, Ed Zitron <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/power-cut/">wrote a great essay</a> on what we know about Microsoft cutting its AI infrastructure spend and what we can piece together. </p><blockquote><p>Microsoft making such a material pullback on data center expansion suggests that <strong>the growth in generative AI products, both those run on Microsoft&#8217;s servers and those sold as part of Microsoft&#8217;s products, do not have the revolutionary growth-trajectory that both CFO Amy Hood and CEO Satya Nadella have been claiming, and this is deeply concerning, while also calling into concern the viability of generative AI as a growth vehicle for any hyperscaler.</strong></p><p>If I am correct, Microsoft is walking away from not just the expansion of its current data center operations, but from generative AI writ large. I actually believe it will continue selling this unprofitable, unsustainable software, because the capacity it has right now is more than sufficient to deal with the lack of demand.</p><p>It is time for investors and the general public to begin demanding tangible and direct numbers on the revenue and profits related to generative AI, as it is becoming increasingly obvious that the revenues are small and the profits are non-existent. <strong>A gigawatt of capacity is huge, and walking away from that much capacity is a direct signal that Microsoft&#8217;s long term plans do not include needing a great deal of compute.</strong></p></blockquote><p><em>The Financial Times </em>has a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/92e332dc-4eba-4a97-811f-0b9df255c54e">great Big Read on British fintech vampires</a> drooling at the chance to enter the US market. </p><blockquote><p>While they have started to generate profits, they do not yet lend at scale and are rarely used as primary salary-receiving accounts. Their lower deposit bases and small-scale lending have left them over-reliant on revenue from sources such as payment fees and, in a competitive market such as the UK, limit their growth.</p><p>&#8220;For&#8201;.&#8201;.&#8201;. banks that have a single product, the only way to really scale and bring the valuation higher is by getting a bigger population pool,&#8221; says Pierre Legrand, a fintech analyst at consultancy Alvarez &amp; Marsal. &#8220;If you live here in the UK, you&#8217;re not going to get that very easily because of the sheer numbers and the saturation in the market.&#8221;</p><p>Another attractive feature of the US market is that interchange fees &#8212; levied by card networks such as Visa and Mastercard on behalf of banks &#8212; are higher in the US than in the EU and the UK, where they are capped. This means that for the same number of payments, a US customer is more profitable.</p></blockquote><p>Over at <em>Africa Is a Country</em>, Jennifer D. Daniel wrote about <a href="https://africasacountry.com/2025/02/the-gig-economys-false-promise">the gig economy in Africa</a>. </p><blockquote><p>Consider the much-lauded ride-hailing sector. Championing flexible hours and easy onboarding, these platforms initially appear to liberate workers from the joblessness that afflicts so many young people across Africa. Yet listen to the drivers themselves, and you&#8217;ll hear a consistent refrain: fluctuating commissions, price surges that benefit the platform but not the worker, and no safety nets if they fall ill or their cars break down.</p><p>For many, this isn&#8217;t the independence they were promised&#8212;it&#8217;s a digital twist on indentured labor. In much the same way that colonial mining companies trapped workers in debt cycles through company-owned housing and provisions, today&#8217;s ride-hailing giants encourage drivers to take out car or motorbike loans, only for many to realize they will never break even. Platforms set the terms, dictating rates and slashing driver earnings at will. If a driver dares to protest? The algorithm can deactivate them overnight&#8212;no severance, no recourse, no explanation.</p></blockquote><p>News that China <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-set-up-national-venture-capital-guidance-fund-state-planner-says-2025-03-06/">announced</a> a $1 trillion yuan national venture capital guidance fund (at $138 billion, that&#8217;s more than SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 1) led me to <a href="https://www.high-capacity.com/p/a-warped-hall-of-mirrors-us-china">this piece by Kyle Chan</a> on how US-China competition is distorting how each country pursues industrial strategy and responds to the other&#8217;s. </p><blockquote><p>One major difference between American and Chinese industrial policy that I would highlight is what I call the persistence gap. The Third Plenum resolution lays out the next phase of an industrial strategy that China has been pursuing for years if not decades. China&#8217;s persistence in areas like electric vehicles, lithium batteries, and even aircraft manufacturing seems to be paying off. The US, on the other hand, faces the risk of sharp pivots in its industrial policy. The sizable progress made in bringing in foreign investment and building up American manufacturing through the IRA and CHIPS Act could be in jeopardy if a new administration decides to abandon these programs. This policy uncertainty and instability creates a &#8220;policy discount factor&#8221; that undercuts the crowding-in effect of industrial policy when it comes to attracting long-term private investment.</p></blockquote><p>There was also <a href="https://www.high-capacity.com/p/a-warped-hall-of-mirrors-us-china">an interesting discussion</a> about what the &#8220;guidance&#8221; actually means here. </p><p>Finally got a chance to start Liz Pelly&#8217;s <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Mood-Machine/Liz-Pelly/9781668083505">&#8220;Mood Machine,&#8221;</a> which dives into Spotify's plot against music&#8212;and brings to mind Nick Seaver&#8217;s <a href="https://nickseaver.net/computing-taste">&#8220;Automating Taste&#8221;</a> (which me and Jathan talked about on our podcast <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thismachinekillspod/240-anthropology-of-algorithms-ethnography-of-engineers-theory-of-traps-ft-nick-seaver">well over two years ago</a>). Here&#8217;s <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2025/01/the-ghosts-in-the-machine-liz-pelly-spotify-musicians/">an excerpt</a> which ran in <em>Harper&#8217;s</em> earlier this year:</p><blockquote><p>Like many other tech companies in the twenty-first century, Spotify spent its first decade claiming to disrupt an archaic industry, scaling up as quickly as possible, and attracting venture capitalists to an unproven business model. In its search for growth and profitability, Spotify reinvented itself repeatedly: as a social-networking platform in 2010, as an app marketplace in 2011, and by the end of 2012, as a hub for what it called &#8220;music for every moment,&#8221; supplying recommendations for specific moods, activities, and times of day. Spotify made its move into curation the next year, hiring a staff of editors to compile in-house playlists. In 2014, the company was increasing its investment in algorithmic personalization technology. This innovation was intended, as Spotify put it, to &#8220;level the playing field&#8221; for artists by minimizing the power of major labels, radio stations, and other old-school gatekeepers; in their place, it claimed, would be a system that simply rewarded tracks that streamed well. By the mid-2010s, the service was actively recasting itself as a neutral platform, a data-driven meritocracy that was rewriting the rules of the music business with its playlists and algorithms.</p><p>In reality, Spotify was subject to the outsized influence of the major-label oligopoly of Sony, Universal, and Warner, which together owned a 17 percent stake in the company when it launched. The companies, which controlled roughly 70 percent of the market for recorded music, held considerable negotiating power from the start. For these major labels, the rise of Spotify would soon pay off. By the mid-2010s, streaming had cemented itself as the most important source of revenue for the majors, which were raking in cash from Spotify&#8217;s millions of paying subscribers after more than a decade of declining revenue. But while Ek&#8217;s company was paying labels and publishers a lot of money&#8212;some 70 percent of its revenue&#8212;it had yet to turn a profit itself, something shareholders would soon demand. In theory, Spotify had any number of options: raising subscription rates, cutting costs by downsizing operations, or finding ways to attract new subscribers.</p></blockquote><p>In <em>The Guardian</em>, Brett Christophers wrote about why <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/03/bp-green-ambitions-climate-emergency-capitalism">capitalism itself can&#8217;t stop climate change</a>:</p><blockquote><p> In the half-decade after the 2015 UN climate change conference in Paris, European governments briefly talked a good game about taking actions &#8211; even up to the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-are-stranded-assets/">stranding of hydrocarbon assets</a> &#8211; that might actually make fossil-fuel production less profitable in the medium and long term. Hence why BP, Shell and others then started making plans to transition into cleaner energy. They wanted to be ahead of the curve, or at any rate, not too far behind it.</p><p>But since 2020, governments have shown that it was in fact just talk. Most notably, they have continued to issue licences for new oil and gas production at near-record rates, despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/18/no-new-investment-in-fossil-fuels-demands-top-energy-economist">being told</a> by experts that such licences are fundamentally incompatible with plans for net zero emissions; Norway alone has issued more than 100 <a href="https://www.sodir.no/en/facts/production-licences/licensing-rounds/">new production licences</a> since then. It is this miserable government appeasement that has emboldened BP and the rest to abandon their transition plans. Elliott, the activist shareholder in BP&#8217;s case, merely forced the issue; putting Marx&#8217;s &#8220;coercive law&#8221; into practice.</p></blockquote><p>This slots nicely into his &#8220;rigorous empirical-historical critique of contemporary capitalism&#8221; as Cedric Durand lays out in <a href="https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii147/articles/cedric-durand-landscapes-of-capital">his review of Christophers&#8217; work</a> (Durand&#8217;s <em>New Left Review</em> essay is from May 2024 but pairs well). </p><blockquote><p>Among the questions posed by Christophers&#8217;s work, then, is whether rentierism should be seen as the default state of capitalism or a transitional one, a sign of business-as-usual or one of looming breakdown. His first two books present rentierism as an essential feature of the system which may well last indefinitely. Yet there is evidence to suggest that it is, in fact, a morbid pathology which is already destabilizing accumulation and threatening capital&#8217;s self-reproduction. Over the coming years, the intensification of these systemic convulsions may amount to what the French Regulationists call a <em>grande crise</em>,<em></em>which will demand a major institutional reshuffling. At stake here is the hegemony of finance itself, which looks increasingly vulnerable despite the impressive portfolios of asset managers. Assuming that an eco-socialist alternative remains out of reach, there are at least two possible outcomes to consider.</p></blockquote><p>MJ Crockett is  also in <em>The Guardian </em>writing about an<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/28/ai-empathy-humans"> under-appreciated element of AI hype</a>: it is impressive when diminishing human activity to machine roteness. </p><blockquote><p>All that these examples of so-called &#8220;AI victories&#8221; show us is that machines are better than humans at performing empathy, creativity and conflict resolution in machine-like ways. Considering why these tests are unfair helps us better appreciate our distinctively human<em></em>talents. We build relationships thick with meaning and forge new knowledge out of trusting social bonds. We find common ground reflected in our faces, voices and postures, perhaps because embodied communication helps us recognize our shared mortality. No chatbot can achieve these feats, because chatbots don&#8217;t have bodies, and aren&#8217;t embedded in our social worlds the way our loved ones are.</p></blockquote><p>In <em>The Guardian</em> again, we have Becca Lewis on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/jan/29/silicon-valley-rightwing-technofascism">Silicon Valley&#8217;s crooked timber and the origins of our techno-fascist moment</a>. </p><blockquote><p>An influential Silicon Valley publication runs a cover story lamenting the &#8220;pussification&#8221; of tech. A major tech CEO lambasts a Black civil rights leader&#8217;s calls for diversifying the tech workforce. Technologists rage against the &#8220;PC police&#8221;. </p><p>No, this isn&#8217;t Silicon Valley in the age of Maga. It&#8217;s the tech industry of the 1990s, when observers first raised concerns about the rightwing bend of Silicon Valley and the potential for &#8220;technofascism&#8221;. Despite the industry&#8217;s (often undeserved) reputation for liberalism, its reactionary foundations were baked in almost from the beginning. As Silicon Valley enters a second Trump administration, the gendered roots of its original reactionary movement offer insight into today&#8217;s rightward turn.</p></blockquote><p>Kyle Chaka in <em>The New Yorker</em> is <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/techno-fascism-comes-to-america-elon-musk">searching</a> for historical parallels that make sense of the unholly techno-fascist alliance plaguing us. </p><blockquote><p>Silicon Valley is premised on the idea that its founders and engineers know better than anyone else: they can do better at disseminating information, at designing an office, at developing satellites and advancing space travel. By the same logic, they must be able to govern better than politicians and federal employees. Voguish concepts in Silicon Valley such as seasteading and &#8220;network states&#8221; feature independent, self-contained societies running on tech principles. Efforts to create such entities have either failed or remained confined to the realm of brand-building, as in the startup <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/09/praxis-society-city-dryden-brown-peter-thiel/">Praxis</a>, a hypothetical plan for a new tech-driven city on the Mediterranean. Under the new Trump White House, though, the U.S. government is being offered up as a guinea pig, McElroy said. &#8220;Now that we&#8217;ve got Musk running the state, I don&#8217;t know if they need their little offshore bubbles as much as they thought they did before.&#8221;</p><p>Such visions of a technologized society represent a break from the Make America Great Again populism that drove the first Trump Administration. <em>MAGA</em> reactionaries such as <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/how-big-a-threat-is-steve-bannon">Steve Bannon</a> tend to be skeptical of technological progress; as the journalist James Pogue has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/18/opinion/donald-trump-tech-musk-bannon.html">explained</a>, their goal is to reclaim an American culture &#8220;thought to be lost after decades of what they see as globalist technocracy.&#8221; Bannon has denounced Silicon Valley&#8217;s ideology as &#8220;technofeudalism&#8221; and declared war on Musk. He sees it as antihuman, with U.S. citizens turned into &#8220;digital serfs&#8221; whose freedom is delimited by tech companies. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/opinion/steve-bannon-on-broligarchs-vs-populism.html">a January interview</a> with Ross Douthat, of the <em>Times</em>, Bannon said, &#8220;They have to be stopped. If we don&#8217;t stop it, and we don&#8217;t stop it now, it&#8217;s going to destroy not just this country, it&#8217;s going to destroy the world.&#8221; Whereas the <em>MAGA</em> right wants to restore things as they were (or as they imagine things were), the tech right wants to, in Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s phrasing, break things. In the <em>Times</em> interview, Bannon called Musk &#8220;one of the top accelerationists,&#8221; referencing another technology-inflected political ideology that treats chaos as an inevitability.</p></blockquote><p>And to sum it all up: John Ganz on the <a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/the-abduction-of-mahmoud-khalil">abduction of Mahmoud Khalil</a> and a straightforward articulation of the fire this time.</p><blockquote><p>What&#8217;s doubly disturbing about Khalil&#8217;s arrest is that it appears to have been made in a climate of mob activity and at the incitement of demagogues. Known agitator Shai Davidai has attacked Khalil repeatedly on social media media and called for Secretary of State Marco Rubio to deport him. And Khalil was targeted by the group Betar on one of their deportation hit lists. Betar is a fascist organization founded in the 1920s by Revisionist Ze&#8217;ev Jabotinsky and at one time received support and training from Mussolini&#8217;s Italy. They are labeled as an extremist <a href="https://extremismterms.adl.org/glossary/betar-usa">organization</a> by the Anti-Defamation League, which has shamefully endorsed Khalil&#8217;s abduction.<strong> If organs of state security and petty demagogues and mob leaders are acting in concert to crack down on dissent it is clearly and unequivocally fascist.</strong> I don&#8217;t mean this to be a polemic: it is just the only appropriate term from political science and theory for this type of practice.</p><p>The politics of the situation are murky and perhaps deliberately provocative. The White House made a crude and inflammatory post that included a photo of Khalil and the words &#8220;Shalom Mahmoud.&#8221; Rather than fight antisemitism, this seems almost calculated to promote theories that the U.S. government works on behalf of Zionists. Perhaps the regime took this moment to take a hard line because it was announced that they had engaged in direct talks with Hamas and this is a sop to convince ideologues that Trump isn&#8217;t soft on Palestinians. And perhaps the regime hopes to provoke disruptive protests to further justify and deepen its project of squeezing and trying to break universities, part of its broader assault on the independence of American civil society.</p></blockquote><h2>Listening Recommendations</h2><p>Quinn Slobodian talked about his upcoming book &#8220;Hayek&#8217;s Bastards&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqAtfF3f4D0&amp;ab_channel=TrashfuturePodcast">on the Trashfuture Podcast</a>.

SVC isn&#8217;t just about capital expenditures tacked onto the generative AI hype bubble, though this is certainly a major frontier of the froth&#8212;which is the subject of the first stab. SVC is ultimately about a now-familiar process that has come to dominate much of the economy and our daily lives: a bunch of independent profit-seeking actors have converged on sustaining a certain technology through a frenzy of <strong>overbuilding, overvaluing, and overinvesting</strong> in order to realize excessive gains that can be translated into political power aimed at restructuring society.</p><p><em>If you like my work and want to support me, consider becoming a paid subscriber for <strong>$7 a month</strong> ($5.25 a month with the 5K sale) or <strong>$70 a year</strong> ($52.50 a year with the 5K sale)!

It&#8217;s worth noting while this will not be exclusively on AI, each company insists most of this will be spent on it. </p><p>On the question of whether there is sufficient demand to justify such spending, I align with Ed Zitron&#8217;s repeated warnings that <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/subprimeai/">capital is being misallocated into a bubble</a> that will only benefit firms and individuals motivated by <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/burst-damage/">profits, greed, power, and other forms of transparent self-interest</a>. Still, I think it&#8217;s worth laying out why this overbuilding, overinvesting, and overvaluing frenzy is akin to lemmings running off a cliff&#8212;so we must begin with the actual stuff this sector is building.</p><p>Each company&#8217;s earnings calls hammer home the same constellation of talking points: we are investing in chips, custom silicon, servers, training clusters, data centers, network infrastructure, deep sea cables&#8212;in physical and digital resources that will let us build out the capacity necessary to meet anticipated demand for AI or pursue new developments in the field. </p><h3>AI Capex</h3><p>So, what is &#8220;AI capex&#8221; and why is there so much of it? At its crudest, it is simply the cost of building a physical data center: its land, its power, its cooling systems, its construction materials, its hardware and software components, and the supply chains that make all of it possible.</p><p>Let&#8217;s start with AI infrastructure itself&#8212;compute-intensive set of technologies that require eye-watering sums of capital to build, maintain, and replace. Generative AI requires specialized GPUs, which need to actively use a significant portion of the chip's processing power, which means they generate excessive heat that shortens the lifespan of the chips, racks, servers and clusters that rely on them. Nvidia&#8217;s new line of Blackwell GPUs&#8212;<a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241118PD217/nvidia-blackwell-gpu-design-shipments.html#:~:text=It%20is%20still%20unclear%20if,rack%20exceeds%20US%243%20million.">delayed because of overheating issues</a>&#8212;will cost upwards of $3 million per 72-chip server (large data centers have tens of thousands of servers). On <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/20/nvidia-nvda-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/">an earnings call last year</a>, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang laid out a rosy picture for the company amid the arms race to develop bigger, better foundation models:</p><blockquote><p>You see now that at the tail end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. <strong>The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells.</strong> And so, that kind of gives you a sense of where the industry is moving with respect to pretraining scaling, post-training scaling, and then now very importantly, inference time scaling. And so, the demand is really great for all of those reasons.</p></blockquote><p>The cost of a 100,000 Blackwell cluster is, however, only one piece of the puzzle: it leaves out the cost of buying the land, actually building the data center, powering the project, cooling the equipment, networking the equipment, recruiting talent, finding training data that isn&#8217;t tainted, the dominant path of model innovation (<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-scaling-laws/#:~:text=The%20recent%20rise%20of%20test,required%20to%20solve%20a%20task.">towards compute-intensive &#8220;reasoning&#8221; models</a>), <strong>and</strong> replacing all of this over time at greater and greater scale. Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/22/24162860/nvidia-ai-chip-every-year-blackwell-rubin">intends on releasing new chips each year</a>, so you&#8217;ll have to figure out how to balance burning out the chips to push ahead and burning out your wallet to buy next-gen chips to burn out to push ahead. And on Nvidia&#8217;s most recent earnings call, Huang <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-reasoning-models-require-more-compute-2025-2">claimed</a> "Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute. Future reasoning can consume much more compute."</p><p><em>Translation: Save up a few billion dollars if you want to start playing with the majors, then another few billion to keep up! Then another few billion to make X amount of money off of products that don&#8217;t exist, work well, or see wide use&#8212;in part because of their ill-defined markets and applications, alongside unsustainable unit economics.</em></p><p>Over at venture capital firm Sequoia Capital (which has invested in Nvidia, OpenAI, and an AI firm started by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever), partner David Cahn has <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/">argued</a> that the overbuilding caused by the AI capex arms race is actually rational from a game theory perspective:</p><blockquote><p>In fact, the more you believe in AI, the more you might be concerned that AI model progress will outpace physical infrastructure, leaving the latter outdated.<strong></strong>For example, once everyone has 100k clusters, big tech companies will need to figure out what to do with their 50k and 25k clusters. We&#8217;ve heard a few industry experts make comments along the lines of: <em>No one will ever train a frontier model on the same data center twice</em>&#8212;by the time the model has been trained, the GPUs will have become outdated, and frontier cluster sizes will have grown. There is also the issue of how much power you need for a given real estate footprint and how dense to pack your GPU racks, decisions that are dependent on GPU power efficiency&#8212;a moving target.</p><p>The key to understanding the pace of today&#8217;s infrastructure buildout is to recognize that while AI optimism is certainly a driver of AI CapEx, it is not the only one. The cloud players exist in a ruthless oligopoly with intense competition. This is no small prize to defend&#8212;the cloud business today is a $250B market, roughly the same size as the entire SaaS sector, combined. The cloud giants see AI as both a threat and an opportunity and do not have the luxury to wait and see how the technology evolves. They must act now.</p><p>The arms race between Microsoft, Amazon and Google is thus game theoretic. Every time Microsoft escalates, Amazon is motivated to escalate to keep up. And vice versa. We are now in a cycle of competitive escalation between three of the biggest companies in the history of the world, collectively worth more than $7T. At each cycle of the escalation, there is an easy justification&#8212;we have plenty of money to afford this. With more commitment comes more confidence, and this loop becomes self-reinforcing. Supply constraints turbocharge this dynamic: If you don&#8217;t acquire land, power and labor now, someone else will.</p></blockquote><p>Regardless of whether or not we need this AI infrastructure, Cahn believes this is akin to a grand state infrastructure project&#8212;the risk is borne by the tech firms collectively spending hundreds of billions (instead of governments/taxpayers), and it&#8217;ll function as a subsidy to everyone who builds something with this new capacity. This metaphor, of course, is confused dogshit. </p><p>Infrastructure projects, when they&#8217;re not speculative time-bombs, tend to have some sense of revenue&#8212;they have some way to make good to investors and creditors. If we proposed a toll highway in a city where post-COVID there was massive migration out of the city, bringing traffic to an all-time low, it would still have a higher credit rating and a more concrete plan to make money (albeit declining ones) than the AI Capex as Infrastructure: spending hundreds of billions of dollars to make a few billion on disappointing and limited use products. </p><p>It&#8217;s worth looking at, however, complicating points Cahn has raised himself. In <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/follow-the-gpus-perspective/">September 2023</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">June 2024</a>, he argued there was a huge gap between revenue expectations promised by the AI infrastructure overbuild and actual revenue growth&#8212;first a measly $200 billion, which then grew to $600 billion. Cahn is certain that a "huge amount of economic value is going to be created by AI,&#8221; that we are living through what may be a "generation-defining technology wave,&#8221; and that AI capex is akin to building railroads. Still he presses four points:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lack of pricing power</strong>: Cahn believes that while railroads confer natural monopolistic advantages (there is only so much track space between two points), the same is not true of GPU data centers. GPU computing is becoming commoditized, AI compute can be offered through the cloud, and so prices are getting competed down to their marginal cost (airlines are offered as an example).</p></li><li><p><strong>Investment incineration:</strong> Speculative investment frenzies are common! The underlying asset is not more impervious to zeroing out because large hoards of capital were poured into it; "It's hard to pick winners, but much easier to pick losers (canals, in the case of railroads).&#8221;</p></li><li><p><strong>Depreciation: </strong>Compute differs from physical infrastructure in that it follows Moore&#8217;s Law. The continuous production of next-generation chips with lower costs and higher performance will accelerate the depreciation of the last-generation of chips. This goes both ways: markets will overestimate the value of today&#8217;s chips and under-appreciate the value of tomorrow&#8217;s chips. "Because the market under-appreciates the B100 and the rate at which next-gen chips will improve, it overestimates the extent to which H100s purchased today will hold their value in 3-4 years."</p></li><li><p><strong>Winners vs losers: </strong>Long term, declining prices for GPU computing will be a boon for innovation/startups, but a bane for investors. "founders and company builders will continue to build in AI&#8212;and they will be more likely to succeed, because they will benefit both from lower costs and from learnings accrued during this period of experimentation."</p></li></ul><p>If we entertain the idea that AI capex is like infrastructure, Cahn&#8217;s points complicate things more than he may realize:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lack of pricing power:</strong> It&#8217;s not clear why GPU commodification will mean GPU data centers and AI cloud will be low barrier to entry. First, consider the differentiation that already exists when it comes to GPU software stacks, or the specialized infrastructure required to handle frontier models, or the geopolitics that may push countries to back national champions&#8212;why wouldn&#8217;t these forces drive markets towards monopolies or oligopolies? Second, why are we ignoring the tech industry&#8217;s history? Have large tech firms really <strong>never</strong> leveraged their scale into predatory pricing power? <strong>Never</strong> colluded on prices? <strong>Never</strong> carved up markets and ecosystems into walled gardens? Third, GPU data centers are capital intensive and GPU supply chains are strained by demand for Nvidia's newest chips swells. As hyperscalers build larger frontier clusters that demand a larger share of Nvidia&#8217;s next-gen chips, and energy/land/water constraints tether this all to physical assets with intrinsic value. Fourth, airlines aren&#8217;t a great example here! Not only do airlines employ <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41272-018-00162-6">revenue maximization schemes that bear no resemblance to marginal cost pricing</a>, they were the some of the earliest adopters and innovators of <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/2024-06-05-three-algorithms-in-a-room/">algorithmic price-fixing</a>, eventually setting up a clearinghouse for the industry to collude on pushing fares upwards&#8212;the DOJ filed a lawsuit but opted to settle, leaving <a href="https://prospect.org/power/unfriendly-skies/">much of the cartel in place</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investment incineration</strong>: I agree. I would go a bit further and say firms burning AI capex are obviously incentivized to prevent incineration&#8212;but by inflating value instead of providing it. Venture capitalists, large tech firms, AI startup darlings, they all deploy <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/general/ai-generated-business">thin marketing campaigns</a> for <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/longcon/">unsustainable business models</a>, but the argument seems to be they will eventually grow into profits on a long-enough time scale that also happens to gives every financier an out (exit, acquisition, inflation of other portfolio firms, political power, influence, etc.) even as they rack up inordinate externalities that will, of course, be foisted on the rest of us (ecological degradation, ascendance and empowerment of right-wing tech capitalists, enshittification of products and spheres of daily life onto which half-formed AI goods and services will be grafted onto, monopolization of innovation system in increasingly narrower hands, etc.)</p></li><li><p><strong>Depreciation: </strong>If the assumption that Nvidia will keep producing better chips on a yearly schedule holds true, Cahn is right. But will it? Nvidia&#8217;s chief executive believes his firm&#8217;s progress in AI is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/nvidia-ceo-says-his-ai-chips-are-improving-faster-than-moores-law/">surpassing Moore&#8217;s Law</a> because they&#8217;ve discovered new scaling laws&#8212;Gary Marcus has written <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/a-new-ai-scaling-law-shell-game">extensively</a> about why these claims are likely bunk, but either way we will get a better picture this year of what&#8217;s what. The first phase of this accelerated rollout has already hit road bumps: Blackwell chips were delayed from 2024 to 2025, and the planned next-gen Rubin chips delayed from 2025 to 2026.</p></li><li><p><strong>Winners vs losers: </strong>Here we come to the assumption that overbuilding will make it cheap enough for someone to build the next &#8220;killer app.&#8221; This is an unquestioned article of faith among most financiers and entrepreneurs in the space, but is it <strong>true</strong>?</p></li></ul><p>Last year Goldman Sachs&#8217; report on Generative AI &#8220;Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit&#8221; got a little press but there wasn&#8217;t nearly enough appreciation for (or rebuttal of) Jim Covello, the head of Global Equity Research at Goldman Sachs. As Covello lays out, there&#8217;s little reason to believe Cahn&#8217;s framing about AI Capex driving down costs and spurring innovation:</p><blockquote><p>The idea that technology typically starts out expensive before becoming cheaper is revisionist history. Ecommerce, as we just discussed, was cheaper from day one, not ten years down the road. But even beyond that misconception, the tech world is too complacent in its assumption that AI costs will decline substantially over time. Moore&#8217;s law in chips that enabled the smaller, faster, cheaper paradigm driving the history of technological innovation only proved true because competitors to Intel, like Advanced Micro Devices, forced Intel and others to reduce costs and innovate over time to remain competitive.</p><p>Today, Nvidia is the only company currently capable of producing the GPUs that power AI. Some people believe that competitors to Nvidia from within the semiconductor industry or from the hyperscalers&#8212;Google, Amazon, and Microsoft&#8212; themselves will emerge, which is possible. But that's a big leap from where we are today given that chip companies have tried and failed to dethrone Nvidia from its dominant GPU position for the last 10 years. Technology can be so difficult to replicate that no competitors are able to do so, allowing companies to maintain their monopoly and pricing power. For example, Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML) remains the only company in the world able to produce leading edge lithography tools and, as a result, the cost of their machines has increased from tens of millions of dollars twenty years ago to, in some cases, hundreds of millions of dollars today. Nvidia may not follow that pattern, and the scale in dollars is different, but the market is too complacent about the certainty of cost declines.</p></blockquote><p>Covello occupies the position of a deeply pessimistic skeptic. I encourage you to read his interview in the report, but I&#8217;ll quote one more section where he's asked if AI is comparable to earlier transformative technologies in that their applications were difficult to imagine at first:</p><blockquote><p>The idea that the transformative potential of the internet and smartphones wasn&#8217;t understood early on is false. I was a semiconductor analyst when smartphones were first introduced and sat through literally hundreds of presentations in the early 2000s about the future of the smartphone and its functionality, with much of it playing out just as the industry had expected. One example was the integration of GPS into smartphones, which wasn&#8217;t yet ready for prime time but was predicted to replace the clunky GPS systems commonly found in rental cars at the time. The roadmap on what other technologies would eventually be able to do also existed at their inception. <strong>No comparable roadmap exists today.</strong> AI bulls seem to just trust that use cases will proliferate as the technology evolves. But eighteen months after the introduction of generative AI to the world, not one truly transformative&#8212;let alone cost-effective&#8212;application has been found.</p></blockquote><p>A recent Ed Zitron piece, <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/wheres-the-money/">&#8220;There Is No AI Revolution&#8221;</a> hammers home this point and many more (gAI has few users, few clients, few use cases, but numerous costs and endless bulls), but I want to hammer in on several key points as we enter the final stretch: </p><blockquote><p>Where is the money that this supposedly revolutionary, world-changing industry is making, and will make?</p><p>The answer is simple: I do not believe it exists. Generative AI lacks the basic unit economics, product-market fit, or market penetration associated with any meaningful software boom, and outside of OpenAI, the industry may be pathetically, hopelessly small, all while providing few meaningful business returns and <em><strong>constantly losing money.</strong></em>[sic]</p></blockquote><p>Generative AI business models do not work. They require more training data than currently exists, hundreds of millions of dollars to hire, and burn money for companies offering their services even when customers are paying. In the case of OpenAI, as Zitron lays out, it spent $9 billion to make $4 billion in 2024 and spent all of its revenue + another billion on compute (running models and training them). It loses money on every single paid and free user, increases its burn rate with its paid subscriber base, and if it makes its projected $11.6 billion in 2025 will be "on course to burn over $26 billion in 2025 for a loss of $14.4 billion."  All this despite its relationship with Microsoft:</p><blockquote><p>It's also important to note that OpenAI's costs are partially subsidized by its relationship with Microsoft, which provides cloud compute credits for its Azure service, which is also offered to OpenAI at a discount. Or, put another way, it&#8217;s like OpenAI got paid with airmiles, but the airline lowered the redemption cost of booking a flight with those airmiles, allowing it to take more flights than another person with the equivalent amount of points. At this point, it isn&#8217;t clear if OpenAI is still paying out of the billions of credits it received from Microsoft in 2023 or whether it&#8217;s had to start using cold-hard cash.</p></blockquote><p>As Zitron argues, convincingly I think, the few products OpenAI does offer (such as DeepResearch or Operator) are incredibly expensive and still lose the company money, being of such poor quality that users will engage them more than usual "to try and get the desired output, incurring further costs for OpenAI." It doesn&#8217;t matter how many users it has, it fundamentally loses money and burns more money the more users it garners because of its horrible unit economics and the low quality output of various products that make use even more costly, even when locked away at the highest tier. </p><p><strong>Where does that leave us?</strong> Large tech firms are boosting the inevitability of an AI revolution and spending hundreds of billions of dollars on overbuilding capacity for AI. </p><p><strong>Why are they doing that? </strong>They are locked in an arms race where billions, if not trillions, will be wasted by firms independently trying to create the first wheel (AGI). </p><p><strong>Why is this arms race happening? </strong>Well, these firms believe creating this wheel will revolutionize human civilization and are pursuing products that require higher and higher levels of AI compute infrastructure, and because these firms argue they need even more compute to push the products further. </p><p><strong>Do these products make money?</strong> No. There is a multi-hundred billion dollar revenue hole, pointed to by AI financiers and critics alike, that only grows because generative AI applications lose money on every user and have abysmally low conversion rates from free to paid users. </p><p><strong>Are they widely used?</strong> No. As Zitron <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/wheres-the-money/">puts</a> it, "the entire combined monthly active users of the Copilot, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Perplexity apps amount to 66 million or 19.47% of the entire monthly active users of ChatGPT's mobile app." Web traffic gets us to 161.6 million unique monthly visitors for those competitors&#8212;about 65.69 percent of ChatGPT.com's traffic. If we exclude Deepseek, however, its 39 million monthly active users of ChatGPT's competitor apps and 81.7 million unique monthly visitors to ChatGPT competitor sites. </p><p><strong>Is there any evidence they will be substantially cheaper or more widely adopted in a time horizon that justifies the massive spend or overbuild beyond doing it for the sake of winning the arms race?</strong> No. Comparisons are often made to other technologies that have become foundational to the digital economy, but with revisionist histories that obscure how these digital technologies were always relatively cheap at the start and had early roadmaps to profitability or widespread adoption that are clear from the start. </p><p><strong>So why is this arms race happening?</strong> Well, these firms believe creating this wheel will revolutionize human civilization and are pursuing products that require higher and higher levels of AI compute infrastructure, and these firms argue they need even more compute to push the products further. </p><h2>Cloud Compute</h2><p>Another place to start is with cloud computing infrastructure, of which AI infrastructure is a subset. The former allows customers to rent computing resources (databases, networking, servers, software, storage, etc.) from other companies that actually own or maintain prerequisite physical hardware. This means things like massive data centers, yes, but also CPUs that go into the servers (multiple CPUs) that go into the racks (dozens of servers) that go into clusters (dozens of racks) that go into the data centers (tens or hundreds of thousands of servers). It means the servers within that process and store data, networking equipment that ensure low-latency, virtual resources and machines, and so on. So capex for cloud looks like: buying land and buildings, constructing data centers, physical servers and networking equipment, renovations and upgrades, and maintenance and replacement of servers, among other things. Similar to AI infrastructure, but different when it boils down to the hardware and software.</p><p>If we look at who owns cloud compute infrastructure, we can broadly break it down to a few groups: hyperscalers (large tech firms that own and maintain massive data centers), colocation providers (firms that lease physical space to other firms that want to house hardware off-site), enterprises (large firms that need to own and operate their own data centers). We are going to focus on hyperscalers in this section, but the other groups will emerge in our discussion later.</p><h3>Hyperscalers</h3><p><a href="https://platformonomics.com/2025/02/follow-the-capex-cloud-table-stakes-2024-retrospective/#:~:text=Summary,%25%20from%202023's%20%24155%20billion).">Since 2018</a>, three hyperscalers (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud) have been the largest cloud service providers and currently control two-thirds of the global cloud market. Those &#8220;Big Three&#8221; cumulatively spent $68 billion that year on company-wide capex&#8212;not just on cloud infrastructure, but everything from land, office buildings, autonomous vehicles, satellites, warehouses. In 2019, they spent $73.5 billion, $97 billion in 2020, $124 billion in 2021, $127 billion in 2022, $127 billion in 2023, $212 billion in 2024 (a grand total of $828.5 billion). This year, they&#8217;ll spend about $255 billion and push the cumulative total to $1 trillion these past eight years.</p><p>Hyperscalers vary widely in the details they volunteer about their spending but, like every good ol&#8217; corporation, try to err towards as little as possible, so we&#8217;ll focus on the company that offers a bit more than the rest: Amazon.</p><p>The basic story we are told is that enormous sums of capital invested in cloud compute has paved the way for AI, but it is still woefully insufficient as present and future demand for AI and non-AI services outstrip compute capacity. Cloud compute is important to think about because AI evangelicals often insist they&#8217;ll enjoy similar margins to this sector&#8212;a business unit which accounts a significant share of Amazon&#8217;s and Microsoft&#8217;s profits. </p><p>For the most of its history, Amazon&#8217;s capex has been directed towards building out the e-commerce/delivery/logistics operation. That&#8217;s meant hundreds of warehouses and delivery facilities over the years (from 2020-2022, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-doubled-fulfillment-network-since-202622130.html">it doubled the size of its entire network</a>), an air cargo fleet of 97 planes, a hoard of last-mile delivery vans, sprawling physical locations (e.g. Whole Foods), and so on.</p><p>But Amazon has also invested heavily in AWS though: doubling its data center capacity as enterprises adopted cloud in 2018, taking advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic&#8217;s acceleration of e-commerce, telemedicine, remote work, and virtual education, and most recently in building out its infrastructure in response to the generative AI hype kicked off in 2022.</p><p>Across <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2023/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/">2022</a>, <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2024/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/">2023</a>, and <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2025/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/">2024</a>, AWS has brought in over $270 billion in revenue and logged just shy of $90 billion in operating income&#8212;profits that slightly edged out the parent company&#8217;s profits over the same period. And AWS profits have historically been a key part of <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">Amazon&#8217;s anticompetitive strategy</a>&#8212;the parent company would reinvest as much of its profits as possible into aggressive expansion, cutting costs and subsidizing prices to attract then trap consumers and clients and partners.</p><p>In 2023, when the Federal Trade Commission put out a request for information on cloud computing providers and their services, the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) sent <a href="https://ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ILSR-Comment-Letter-on-Business-Practices-of-Cloud-Computing-Providers-2023.pdf">a comment letter</a> laying out the consequence of hyperscalers (like AWS) dominating cloud compute. The letter is worth going through as it lays out well some key market dynamics of the cloud oligopoly:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Dominant Cloud Providers Have Durable Market Power and Persistently High Profits. </strong>In 2023, AWS controlled 40 percent of the market&#8212;larger than Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud combined. AWS commands <a href="https://www.hava.io/blog/2024-cloud-market-share-analysis-decoding-industry-leaders-and-trends">a smaller lead</a> (32 percent vs 23+10 percent) today, but the cloud market is still an oligopoly with these three controlling two-thirds. At the end of 2022, before Amazon ratcheted up its AWS capex as part of the AI arms race, ILSR notes AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said "more than 90 percent of all cloud-based startups use AWS, while 83 percent of the more than 1,000 technology "unicorns" rely on AWS infrastructure and software. It also dominated cloud services for federal, state, and local governments: over 7,500 local and national government agencies used AWS. Take this, throw in profit margins that are typically around 30 percent, add growth rates that outpaced worldwide growth of the market itself, and you get "durable market power warranting investigation and intervention by regulators."</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Vertical Integration Across the Stack Impedes Competition. </strong>Hyperscalers are vertically integrated, meaning they own multiple parts of their own supply chain&#8212;here, the "infrastructure, platform, and software" that goes into cloud computing. The market's entry barriers may be relatively low, but hyperscalers can leverage their control over its capital-intensive infrastructure and the extent to which their products are integrated throughout the stack, to impose costs that should not exist. Some of the go-to methods for AWS are "customer lock-in and exploitative conduct."</p></li><li><p><strong>Dominant Cloud Providers Erect Barriers to Switching and Multi-Cloud. </strong>AWS uses a variety of tactics to lock-in customers or exploit their reliance on its services. One reliable tool is to charge fees to customers who want to move data off its servers (known as "egress fees"), and make them exorbitant enough to discourage switching elsewhere or using multiple cloud providers. Another is to simply avoid interoperability for non-AWS products and services, creating "technical barriers to both switching cloud providers and integration operations across multiple providers, thus inhibiting competition." These tactics serve to ensure clients stay within the AWS product ecosystem, but to get users through the door in the first place it will offer discounts for bundled use of various tools as well as for long-term contracts that require "some threshold of money spent on services."</p></li><li><p><strong>AWS Leverages Its Infrastructure Dominance to Preference Its Own Applications and Copy the Products Developed by Independent Software Providers. </strong>The sheer dominance of AWS, as with the sheer dominance of Amazon's retail operation, means that independent developers must offer their products on AWS's marketplace. This lets Amazon surveil and access their data and restrict their ability to promote those products elsewhere, but is a key part of Amazon and AWS&#8217;s <a href="https://www.inc.com/sonya-mann/aws-startups-conflict.html">long-documented</a> practice of copying products offered by vendors on their platforms and aggressively self-preferencing the stolen designs. </p></li><li><p><strong>Amazon Has Used Acquisitions to Cement Its Dominance in Cloud. </strong>This is a hallowed practice in our tech sector: acquire your way to a competitive advantage. ILSR's major example is Amazon's acquisition of Annapurna Labs in 2015, allowing for the development of Graviton microchips which attracted major clients to AWS, further entrenched its market power, and helped sustain stupendous growth for revenue and profits. As of 2021, Graviton servers generated over $5 billion in revenue each year. </p></li><li><p><strong>Amazon Exploits AWS to Advantage Its Other Business Lines. </strong>AWS, as should be abundantly clear by now, provides "crucial" services to companies across the economy&#8212;including firms which are Amazon competitors. How does Amazon navigate these conflicts-of-interest? One way is by cross-leveraging AWS and other business lines to undermine its competition, as it did in 2020 when Amazon agreed to carry HBO Max on its Fire TV product when Warner Media agreed to renew its AWS contract. Other times, it will use "the market intelligence that Amazon gleans from providing cloud services" to "move into new industries with a built-in and unfair advantage." At the same time that AWS offered cloud-based tools for the health care sector, it pivoted towards the industry and acquired incumbent firms like One Medical to gain a foothold. If none of that sounds appealing, Amazon can also charge a non-cloud direct competitor for cloud services (while enjoying those same services itself at a discount for, say, its retail platform). When Amazon acquired Twitch in 2014, it acquired the tech behind what would become "AWS-based Amazon Interactive Video Service" (IVS). All and well, except that technology is the backbone of Kick, Twitch's main rival. "This means that Amazon competitor Kick must pay sizeable fees to Amazon for cloud services, including the pivotal IVS service, while Twitch likely pays much less for these same services."</p></li><li><p><strong>Major Cloud Providers Control the Development of AI and Stand to Gain More Power Across Society as AI is Deployed in a Broad Array of Uses. </strong>AI infrastructure, built atop cloud compute infrastructure, will "further entrench the market power of the dominant cloud computing providers, as only they currently have the compute power, financial resources, and massive data sets needed to develop and train AI models. Because of these high thresholds, smaller AI companies must partner with one of the large cloud providers to viably develop and offer AI products, as Open AI did with Microsoft." Or as Amazon does with Anthropic. No one should entertain the idea of letting oligopolistic cloud providers like Amazon dominate the generative AI market, whether or not you believe it will create something of value, given how exploitative their business practices are in cloud.</p></li></ol><p>AI infrastructure is a subset of cloud compute infrastructure, so what do we see when we examine the latter&#8217;s market dynamics? The vast majority of market is dominated by three firms who deploy deeply exploitative business practices that leverage their hyperscale infrastructure to extract rents, steal ideas, deter competitors, trap clients, and enter new markets with built-in advantages. One way to understand the sky-high levels of &#8220;AI capex&#8221; is that firms recognize there <strong>is</strong> an opportunity here: to create another industry that resembles cloud&#8212;not in its utility or ubiquity but in its rents, anti-competitive market intelligence, and persistently high margins. Or to put it another way, one reason why AI capex seems to only be going higher is that firms are eager to sustain levels of growth and profit that only come about by rigging a market&#8217;s infrastructure (its regulations, practices, prices, and participants). Spend enough money and you may get the first mover advantage, or be able to join the hallowed few who enjoy something like it.</p><h1>AI==energy infrastructure</h1><p>Our discussion of upward pressures on AI capex as it relates to compute infrastructure is only <strong>one</strong> part of the Silicon Valley Consensus. The next part boils down to how eager the most powerful and wealthy sectors of our society are to preserve their power and privilege with artificial intelligence. We will focus on energy supply and demand&#8212;specifically, the fossil fuel industry which wants to power AI infrastructure <strong>and</strong> be powered by it&#8212;but this can also be applied to the AI-mediated privatization of healthcare, ascent of defense tech startups, or coming deluge of fintech.</p><p>As Kate Aronoff <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191506/musk-bezos-pichai-zuckerberg-microsoft-trump-climate">writes</a> for <em>The New Republic,</em> the few tech firms already firmly in control of key parts of global AI compute have made it no secret they felt constrained by net-zero pledges, sustainability commitments, and climate agreements&#8212;just like the fossil fuel industry:</p><blockquote><p>On a recent quarterly earnings <a href="https://archive.ph/o/lWxMP/https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/06/amazoncom-amzn-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript/">call</a>, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy called AI the &#8220;biggest opportunity in business since the internet.&#8221; The main constraint on its growth, he added, is energy. &#8220;I think the world is still constrained on power from where I think we all believe we could serve customers if we were unconstrained,&#8221; he told investor analysts.</p><p>Fossil fuel companies are cashing in on Silicon Valley&#8217;s newfound thirst. &#8220;Data centers are learning a lot about the natural gas business and how critical it is to what they&#8217;re doing,&#8221; Marshall McCrea, CEO of the pipeline firm Energy Transfer, told investor analysts recently. &#8220;And man, we couldn&#8217;t be more pleased and excited about this new business.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s also important to note that while Trump&#8217;s ascension is accelerating the shift here, it&#8217;s been in the works for a while. Back in September, Brian Merchant <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-is-revitalizing-the-fossil-fuels">wrote</a> a bit on how AI firms were making the climate crisis worse in at least three ways: selling tools to boost fossil fuel extraction, planning to exponentially build out energy-intensive compute, and giving fossil fuel companies alongside utilities excuses to overbuild infrastructure. Take Bloomberg&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-16/us-natural-gas-power-plants-just-keep-coming-to-meet-ai-ev-electricity-demand">reporting</a> last year which revealed that the ongoing AI frenzy was already leading to a revival of US natural gas-fire power generation:</p><blockquote><p>In the first six months of the year alone, companies have announced plans to build more new gas power capacity across the US than they did in all of 2020, data from Sierra Club show. And if the second half looks anything like the first, 2024 will mark the most new gas-power generation announced since at least 2017, when the environmental group started tracking the data.</p></blockquote><p>Is this bad? Bloomberg notes that natural gas generation is likely to leak methane, which has "80 times the planet-warming impact of carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere" and which will come from new gas plants that will "run for 40 years or longer." Decarbonization goals are also being &#8220;quietly&#8221; revised downwards, renewable energy projects are being canceled, and a big thumbs up is given to building out data centers such that they&#8217;ll surge their domestic energy demand from 1 percent today to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/data-centers-could-use-9-us-electricity-by-2030-research-institute-says-2024-05-29/">nine percent</a> by 2030. Or consider Merchant&#8217;s observation: &#8220;If you think the web is overrun with AI content now, imagine a world where one tenth of all the electricity we generate is going into pumping out more of the stuff.&#8221;</p><p>Now, every single infrastructure project doesn&#8217;t get built simply because analysts project it or because the capital is out there. <em>Bloomberg</em> echoes the same point in their reporting:</p><blockquote><p>Of course, not every announced plant makes it through construction or ultimately connects to the grid. Sierra Club says about 10 gigawatts of earlier plans were canceled last year compared to the nearly 45 gigawatts announced. Berkeley Lab <a href="https://archive.ph/o/vk6XH/https://emp.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/Queued%20Up%202024%20Edition_R2.pdf">estimates</a> only about one-third of interconnection requests have historically resulted in active gas plants, though that&#8217;s higher than either wind (20%) or solar (13%). Some planned projects will may also get scrapped over concerns their cost will further inflate <a href="https://archive.ph/o/vk6XH/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-09/interest-rate-cuts-unlikely-to-lower-energy-costs-for-americans">rising power prices</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Still, AI hysteria serves as a potent marketing strategy for actors looking to drive investment, hype products, inflate valuations, justifying the build out of new infrastructure (or entangling existing one). A <a href="https://ieefa.org/articles/data-centers-drive-buildout-gas-power-plants-and-pipelines-southeast">recent report</a> from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis suggests ratepayers will subsidize the proposed overbuilding of electrical infrastructure that is largely being driven by "forecasted demand" for data centers:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;There is a serious risk of overbuilding electrical infrastructure to meet data center demand that may not materialize. Utilities already are financially incentivized to overbuild infrastructure, and this risk is exacerbated by the uncertainty surrounding data center demand, particularly as it relates to AI,&#8221; said Cathy Kunkel, IEEFA energy consultant and author of the report. &#8220;In the absence of proactive decisions by utilities or regulators, electric ratepayers will subsidize the building of new infrastructure that would not be needed in the absence of data centers and will be on the hook for overbuilt infrastructure.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Tech has been bolstering fossil fuel extraction <a href="https://logicmag.io/nature/oil-is-the-new-data/">for some time now</a>, as JS Tan wrote for <em>Logic(s)</em> nearly six years ago. Microsoft signed a 7 year contract with Chevron in 2017, announced major partnerships with oil giants in 2018, and signed a 2019 deal with ExxonMobil that was claimed to (then) be "the industry's largest [contract] in cloud computing." Why?</p><blockquote><p>Oil companies like Chevron are the perfect customer for cloud providers. For years, they have been generating enormous amounts of data about their oil wells. Chevron alone has thousands of oil wells around the world, and each well is covered with sensors that generate more than a terabyte of data per day. (A terabyte is 1,000 gigabytes.)</p><p>At best, Chevron has only been able to use a fraction of that data. One problem is the scale of computation required. Many servers are needed to perform the complex workloads capable of analyzing all of this data. As a result, computational needs may skyrocket&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but then abruptly subside when the analysis is complete. These sharp fluctuations can put significant pressure on a company like Chevron. During spikes, their data centers lack capacity. During troughs, they sit idly.</p><p>This is where the promise of the public cloud comes in. Oil companies can solve their computational woes by turning to the cloud&#8217;s renting model, which gives them as many servers as they need and allows them to pay only for what they use.</p></blockquote><p>And as Karen Hao <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/09/microsoft-ai-oil-contracts/679804/?gift=lhL3dXSYCcu9vqTqEbg0OHfJiu_TRdq079IHN4QaSAE&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share">wrote</a> last year, Microsoft has gone out of its way to pitch generative artificial intelligence as &#8220;a powerful tool for finding and developing new oil and gas reserves and maximizing their production&#8212;all while publicly committing to dramatically reduce emissions.&#8221; The sums involved are potentially massive: in 2024, the oil and gas sector spent a little over <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/ai-oil-industry-profit-permian-basin-8adcacdd">$3 billion on artificial intelligence</a>, but Microsoft believes this will can grow to $75 billion soon. The defense Microsoft offers here is a bit unbelievable: yes, the products are being used to boost the productivity of fossil fuel extraction, but they are reducing the emissions generated by extraction itself. On top of this, it&#8217;s important to stop and think about what has to happen so that Microsoft can supposedly green Chevron&#8217;s fossil fuel extraction: </p><blockquote><p>Lucas Joppa, Microsoft&#8217;s first chief environmental officer, who left the company in 2022, fears that the world will not be able to reverse the current trajectory of AI development even if the technology is shown to have a net-negative impact on sustainability. Companies are designing specialized chips and data centers just for advanced generative-AI models. Microsoft is <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-plot-100-billion-stargate-ai-supercomputer">reportedly</a> planning a $100 billion supercomputer to support the next generations of OpenAI&#8217;s technologies; it could require as much energy annually as 4 million American homes. <strong>Abandoning all of this would be like the U.S. outlawing cars after designing its entire highway system around them.</strong></p><p>Therein lies the crux of the problem: In this new generative-AI paradigm, uncertainty reigns over certainty, speculation dominates reality, science defers to faith. The hype around generative AI is accelerating fossil-fuel extraction while the technology consumes unprecedented amounts of energy. As Joppa told me: &#8220;This must be the most money we&#8217;ve ever spent in the least amount of time on something we fundamentally don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This sentiment is not limited to Microsoft, however&#8212;Silicon Valley&#8217;s ethos can be summed up as: <em>why shouldn&#8217;t we?</em> Or, as former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt put it: &#8220;we&#8217;re not going to hit the climate goals anyway&#8221; so why not gamble on artificial intelligence squaring this circle? Microsoft and Google (two of the largest hyperscalers) admit their data center expansion plans have ruined their sustainability goals: Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/15/microsofts-carbon-emissions-have-risen-30percent-since-2020-due-to-data-center-expansion.html">emissions are up 29 percent since 2020</a> and Google&#8217;s are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-02/google-s-emissions-shot-up-48-over-five-years-due-to-ai">up 48 percent since 2019</a>. A <em>Guardian</em> analysis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/15/data-center-gas-emissions-tech">found</a> that from 2020 to 2022, real emissions from company-owned data centers of Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple where about 662 percent higher than officially reported thanks to "creative accounting.&#8221; </p><p>Similarly, the sentiment coming out of the fossil fuel sector is: <em>why shouldn&#8217;t we</em>? Or as one geoscientist turned financial analyst told writer Malcolm Harris at a Shell event: <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/shell-climate-change.html">&#8220;We don&#8217;t plan on losing any money&#8221;</a>&#8212;in fact we plan on making more money! As Harris lays out in the introduction of his forthcoming book <em><a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/malcolm-harris/whats-left/9780316577434/?lens=little-brown">What&#8217;s Left</a></em>, oil companies have no reason to think they won&#8217;t make more: they're public firms with a responsibility to their investors to seek profits, and they&#8217;re eager to disregard studies that say the vast majority of oil and gas reserves are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34497394/">unextractable</a> from an ecological perspective&#8212;from the market perspective, these reserves promise to heighten record levels of <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/08/24/fossil-fuel-subsidies-surged-to-record-7-trillion">subsidies</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/big-oil-doubles-profits-blockbuster-2022-2023-02-08/">profits</a>. </p><p>If you want even greater levels of historic profits, this logic demands you look to the products Silicon Valley insists will revolutionize human civilization. And if you are a Silicon Valley firm looking for a proven use case for a technology sufficiently attractive to investors, why not look to the industry that is making more money than God destroying the world AND already planning out scenarios on how to best support your proliferation!</p><p>Going back to Aronoff's article, she cites one of the scenarios in Shell's latest <a href="https://archive.ph/o/lWxMP/https://www.shell.com/news-and-insights/scenarios/the-2025-energy-security-scenarios/_jcr_content/root/main/section_1902297548/promo/links/item0.stream/1739350201946/5d5adeef7a9afcc42a8ba3547ed7a7ce0afa4f80/the-2025-energy-security-scenarios.pdf">Shell Energy Security Scenarios</a>: "Surge," a future where our glorious private sector overinvests in and overbuilds compute infrastructure, fossil fuel infrastructure, and electrical infrastructure.</p><blockquote><p>This AI-centric scenario sees &#8220;relative resilience for oil and gas production&#8221; owing to &#8220;more buoyant economic growth driving overall energy demand. Although new energy infrastructure appears rapidly, demand is such that existing energy production and systems are retained for longer.&#8221; Thanks to AI and surging economic growth, though, midcentury advancements in direct air capture and small modular nuclear reactors will keep global temperatures from rising by more than two degrees Celsius.</p><p>This is massively optimistic. In Surge, direct air carbon capture and storage, or DACCS, will remove more than 500 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually by 2030, and eight billion metric tons by 2100&#8212;a fifth of what the entire world currently emits each year. That technology is currently removing just <a href="https://archive.ph/o/lWxMP/https://www.iea.org/energy-system/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage/direct-air-capture">0.1 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year</a>, per the International Energy Agency. The IEA&#8217;s own scenario for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050&#8212;which is relatively bullish about DACCS&#8212;forecasts DACCS capturing 65 metric tons by then, with the vast majority of reductions coming from phasing out fossil fuels and scaling up zero-carbon energy.</p></blockquote><p>Some might take a moment to say &#8220;excuse me, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/06/21/artificial-intelligence-nuclear-fusion-climate/">hyperscalers are investing in nuclear power to fuel their AI infrastructure</a>!&#8221; Are we supposed to just not believe tech firms insisting they will invest in and realize a new nuclear age to justify the ravenous growth of their questionable product? <a href="https://diginomica.com/why-hyperscalers-are-going-nuclear-and-why-thats-probably-really-good-idea">Amazon, Google, Microsoft,</a> and <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-launches-nuclear-power-rfp-targets-14gw-for-data-centers/">Meta</a> have all announced plans to invest in and develop nuclear power for their data centers&#8212;in fact, they&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2d84198e-7eeb-4154-bbf2-9a469b0cc700">poured</a> at least $1.5 billion this past year into small modular reactors!</p><p>It&#8217;s not clear why this shouldn&#8217;t be understood as anything more than <strong>greenwashing</strong>. This is the industry&#8217;s oldest trick&#8212;insisting the externalities of their profit-seeking will be mitigated by a moonshot project. Recall cryptocurrency? The speculative vehicle once spun as the future of money, cultural production, decentralized governance, and civilization itself? Just as crypto was struggling to find a use case beyond elaborate Ponzi schemes, financial deregulation, degenerate gambling, and electricity consumption, a new narrative was pitched: it was actually fighting climate change.</p><p>Bitcoin mining wasn&#8217;t straining energy grids worldwide, the industry said, but in fact <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/627aa615676bdd1d47ec97d4/66b123f315203b1865697f9e_BPI%202024%20Policy%20Report%20Aug%205_2024.pdf">optimizing them</a> by consuming wasted energy. Emissions could be significantly curtailed by <a href="https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/publications/carbon-credit-tokenization.html">putting carbon credits on the blockchain</a>, enmeshing them in more transparent, auditable, liquid, and accessible markets. And, more broadly, by fostering the growth of Web3 technologies (the umbrella term for decentralized blockchain-centric projects), we might even create <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/09/regenerative-finance-web3-climate-change/">new &#8220;regenerative finance&#8221; systems</a> that promote nature-based and market-based solutions to climate change.</p><p>All of this turned out to be a crock of shit, of course. With each year that passed, crypto&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/03/crypto-bitcoin-mining-carbon-emissions-climate-change-impact/673468/">negative environmental impact</a> grew alongside its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/technology/bitcoin-miners-environment-crypto.html">persistent</a><a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/4245911-dont-buy-bitcoins-dishonest-attempt-to-paint-itself-green/">greenwashing campaigns</a>. Combining crypto and carbon credits seems to have borne out the worst of both worlds, creating safe havens for <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Carbon-credits-targeted-by-crypto-speculators-fueling-green-bubble">speculators</a> that resemble <a href="https://www.context.news/net-zero/long-read/fears-of-subprime-carbon-assets-stall-crypto-rainforest-mission">the &#8216;08 subprime mortgage market</a>. When we turn to Web3, there is <a href="https://the-crypto-syllabus.com/web3-a-map-in-search-of-territory/">little substance that exists beyond self-referential activity</a> but plenty of the same old nonsense&#8212;<a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/charts/top">over $76 billion has been stolen</a> since January 2021 within that ecosystem.</p><p>So if we return to reality, it&#8217;s obvious that compute infrastructure will substantially be scaled up with the help of fossil fuels&#8212;as we&#8217;ve been illustrating at length in this section. There is more momentum, more profit, and more political interest in doing this than not. Sure, peanuts will be thrown to the moonshot projects. They always are. But in the real world, on the ground, we will see projects like xAI&#8217;s Colossus which hopes to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9c0516cf-dd12-4665-aa22-712de854fe2f">expand tenfold</a> while already <a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/news/elon-musks-xai-facility-is-polluting-south-memphis/">polluting South Memphis with unauthorized methane gas turbines</a>. </p><p>This is the shape of what is to come. In the first section, we talked about the drive to overbuild compute infrastructure coming from firms that own it. In this section, we see another driver to overbuild compute infrastructure coming from fossil fuel extraction and energy production infrastructure that will power AI (or be powered by it). This dynamic can be extended more generally to other industries, but that&#8217;s something we&#8217;ll tackle in later iterations of the Silicon Valley Consensus thesis. </p><p>In the second half, I&#8217;ll talk about:</p><ul><li><p>the role finance plays in overbuilding, overvaluing, and overinvesting AI infrastructure. This ranges from the monopolization of venture capital to the revenue models of data center landlords and the rise of asset manager data center portfolios.</p></li><li><p>the geopolitics driving the AI capex momentum, the ways close ties with the military-industrial complex would benefit speculators interested in overbuilding, overvaluing, and overinvesting AI infrastructure, and the reactionary political projects seeking to benefit from it.</p></li><li><p>the fragility of this drive to overbuild/overvalue/overinvest AI infrastructure and how many things have to go right to sustain the bubble thriving in the gap between reality (demand) and the predations of various sectors of our economy.</p></li><li><p>using SVC to map out frothy frontiers of Silicon Valley boosterism beyond AI capex: crypto, surveillance, defense tech, digitization, fintech, telemedicine, and more.</p></li></ul><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/the-silicon-valley-consensus-and/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/the-silicon-valley-consensus-and/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p>]]>

Thanks for all the emails with stories about your own experiences in Vegas, with gambling addiction, and with CES in response to my last piece, I read them all and responded to most except the ones pitching me Guaranteed Parlays That Will Hit!

If you like what you&#8217;ve read and want to support me further, you can become a paid subscriber for $7 a month or $70 a year. What do you get in return? My undying love, some recommendation posts every now and then, and paywalled essays/rants just as long as this one! Now, let&#8217;s get to today&#8217;s essay.</p><div><hr></div><p>I have long believed that one of the greatest threats we face is the proliferation of the on-demand labor platform. The so-called &#8220;gig economy&#8221; is one of the larger altars to greed and misery in our civilization where millions of people are sacrificed in order to grow Smaugian hoards that are then transmuted into this or that form of power.</p><p>My earliest introduction to this was through the work of labor ethnographer and legal scholar Veena Dubal via her law journal article <a href="https://repository.uclawsf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2588&amp;context=faculty_scholarship">&#8220;The Drive to Precarity,&#8221; </a>which maps out how militant workers turned San Francisco&#8217;s precarious taxi sector into a stable line of work, how companies responded with a wave of deregulation and de-unionization that immiserated workers, and how Uber sealed the deal in returning ride-hail to its earlier insecure form: poor working conditions and starvation wages, with every possible cost (healthcare, fuel, maintenance, etc.) offloaded onto workers and consumers.</p><p>Key forms of on-demand labor&#8212;namely, ride-hail and food delivery&#8212;have proliferated over the past few years, but not because they are particularly profitable or innovative business ventures. <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/08/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-thirty-three-uber-isnt-really-profitable-yet-but-is-getting-closer-the-antitrust-case-against-uber.html">Most of them either have no real path to profitability, report dubiously calculated profits, or are operating illegally in hopes of realizing or sustaining them after sufficient lobbying and monopolization and exploitation of consumers/workers.</a> The lazy and incurious view has been that they will grow into profitability, but the transparent reality is that the firms at the vanguard of the gig economy have thrived because they take advantage of a few key phenomena: worker misclassification, algorithmic discrimination, anti-competitive capital-intensive strategies, impressive public relations, robust political lobbying, and shoddy journalism, to name a few.</p><p>The ride-hail business model is about <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2024/05/09/inside-uber-political-machine/">subverting urban governance</a>, about <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/digital-piecework/">breaking New Deal era labor regimes</a>, about subjecting workers and workplaces to more <a href="https://www.columbialawreview.org/content/on-algorithmic-wage-discrimination/">authoritarian forms of control and discipline</a>, and about reshaping consumers, markets, firms, governments into forms <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/">less hostile to previously illegal-to-realize profits</a> by leveraging <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/softbanks-new-strategy-screw-over-startups-not-investors/">investor subsidies</a> and <a href="https://yalelawandpolicy.org/overawed-worker-misclassification-potential-unfair-method-competition">worker misclassification</a> as competitive strategies. One way to understand this that I keep returning to and flirting with is it&#8217;s part of an ongoing attempt to find <em>the</em> legitimacy narrative for capitalism, to RETVRN to a purer and more orderly form that also happens resembles the violence and surveillance and hierarchy transferred from plantation to early industrial labor. Still, the question remains what does the application of this business model look like here and now, in various sectors of the economy or in slices of our daily lives?</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">The Tech Bubble is a reader-supported publication.

Uber and its allies were able to send out misleading voting guide mailers, lobby the public with extensive media tours, and cut checks large enough to convince civil rights organizations and activists to parrot corporate talking points. To what end? To ensure drivers were paid starvation wages and forced to bear the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214140519301392?via%3Dihub">heavy cost of gig work on their well-being</a> whether it be mental health, injury, accident, or physical health. After all, such labor costs would&#8217;ve cost already deeply unprofitable companies an additional hundreds of millions of dollars in a sensitive time. Proposition 22 was found <a href="https://www.nelp.org/prop-22-unconstitutional/">unconstitutional</a> before an appeal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/business/prop-22-upheld-california.html#:~:text=upheld%2Dcalifornia.html-,California%20Court%20Mostly%20Upholds%20Prop.,to%20the%20state%20Supreme%20Court.&amp;text=Kellen%20Browning%20writes%20about%20the%20gig%20economy%20and%20its%20workers.">reversed</a> this ruling and California&#8217;s Supreme Court <a href="https://calmatters.org/economy/2024/07/prop-22-california-gig-work-law-upheld/">affirmed</a> the legality of Proposition 22 as well as its exemption of the so-called gig economy from the state&#8217;s labor laws.</p><p>Few financiers bothered to even hide the tent in their pants as all of this was happening. One of the earliest was Shawn Carolan&#8212;a partner at Menlo Ventures and early investor in Uber&#8212;who penned an op-ed in <em>The Information</em> six days after Proposition 22 passed that practically drooled over what could now be done to various industries (and investors):</p><blockquote><p>Workers in all sorts of industries&#8212;from agriculture to zookeeping&#8212;could benefit from the structure that Prop. 22 provides, if it were extended to them. I think it could work for basically any industry where an ongoing relationship with a single employer isn&#8217;t essential to do the job well. It doesn&#8217;t seem viable in sports, for example, to have a different head coach each practice&#8212;the continuity of relationship and knowledge is too important to the core value. But the existence of flexible work arrangements in fields like nursing, executive assistance, tutoring, programming, restaurant work and design suggests that a Prop. 22 inspired approach could make sense there as well.</p></blockquote><p>Carolan breezes through Uber's destructive business model, its war on labor laws and regulatory oversight, a long list of scandals, and outright illegal behavior to insist that it and Proposition 22 are unambiguous goods:</p><blockquote><p>There is an opportunity for us to create a world in which the choice of being a gig worker versus an employee doesn&#8217;t feel like a trade-off, a world in which some or many of the legal benefits and protections employees enjoy extend to gig workers. In this scenario, workers across industries gain security, the relationship between employees and employers is strengthened, and the economy benefits from a more financially secure population, continued innovation and countless new efficiencies.</p></blockquote><p>Everything Carolan&#8212;and every other venture capitalist&#8212;says in defense of misclassifying on-demand workers is, of course, Bullshit. Pablum. Gibberish. Jejune. For years, it has been clear that their framing is a deceptive one: Dubal's ethnographic research, for example, has <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3488009">documented</a> that longtime drivers feel ambivalent about worker status because these firms have made workers feel trapped by algorithmic overseers in exploitative and grueling work schedules for perpetually declining wages; Dubal has also established how on-demand platforms have innovated a new form of price discrimination, shifting it from the consumer to laborer via <a href="https://columbialawreview.org/content/on-algorithmic-wage-discrimination/">algorithmic wage discrimination</a> (which Uber admitted to doing <a href="https://novaramedia.com/2024/02/13/uber-boss-makes-shocking-admission-over-algorithmic-wage-discrimination/">last year</a>) to ensure each worker gets the lowest compensation possible (though they also practice <a href="https://www.nelp.org/ubers-price-gouging-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/">algorithmic price discrimination</a> too). </p><p>Inconvenient truths, yes, but there&#8217;s no reason why any of this would stop so-called gig economy firms: again, companies whose business models deeply immoral and deeply committed to operating outside the boundaries of the law (in order to change the law). This has been clear for a long while, but was emphasized <strong>the day after</strong> Proposition 22 passed when Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi bragged on the Q3 earnings call that the ballot measure was <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/11/05/uber-ceo-sees-california-ballot-initiative-as-a-model-for-other-states-9424660">just the beginning</a>&#8212;the first iteration being its <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-is-ic-ubers-new-plan-to-warp-labor-laws-nationwide/">Independent Contractor Plus model</a> (&#8220;IC+). </p><p>Since Uber, Lyft, Doordash, and Instacart bribed their way to a labor law exemption in California, how have things gone for the companies since? <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/uber-lyft-are-winning-the-gig-worker-war-in-states-and-courts">Pretty good, actually</a>.

The United Kingdom's Supreme Court classified drivers as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56123668">"workers"</a> in 2021, but Uber was <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tech/uber-driver-rights-minimum-wage-supreme-court-workers-self-employed-b1086382.html">sued in 2023</a> for reneging on its promise.

Across the world and at home, Uber and its conspirators have enjoyed victory after victory since Proposition 22.</p><p>It&#8217;s hard to overstate the aggression with which Uber pursued its ambitions. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jul/10/uber-files-leak-reveals-global-lobbying-campaign">2022 Uber Files</a> (leaked by the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jul/11/uber-files-whistleblower-lobbyist-mark-macgann">former top lobbyist in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa</a>) revealed years of illegal behavior, aggressive attempts to evade accountability, and lobby various governments to rewrite laws in the company&#8217;s favor. We&#8217;ve also witnessed, in daylight, Uber&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2024/05/09/inside-uber-political-machine/">impressive political machine</a>; here&#8217;s Katie Wells, Declan Cullen, and Kafui Attoh put it in <em>The New York Review of Books</em> on Uber&#8217;s advocacy strategy:</p><blockquote><p>The recent pattern is clear: Uber sells itself as pro-worker in name while opposing legislation that would require it to be so in practice. In 2020, after Seattle enacted a minimum wage for ride-hail drivers, the company went to the Washington statehouse to pressure legislators to alter the law, which they rewrote in a manner that at once denied gig workers employee status and established the country&#8217;s first paid sick leave program for ride-hail drivers. The national Teamsters union rejected the resulting 2022 law, but the local union supported it, maintaining that it was better to cut a deal and avoid a potential ballot initiative than fight for employee status. In 2023 in New York state, Uber similarly agreed to give UberEats drivers a minimum wage and paid sick leave but not treat its workers as employees. This year in Toronto, it celebrated a partnership with the United Food and Commercial Workers union to assist drivers with deactivation appeals, even as it campaigned against minimum wages for them.</p></blockquote><p>Since Uber began selling off <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/uber-sells-off-sci-fi-pipe-dreams-exploiting-human-labor-is-its-only-plan/">nearly every other line of business</a> (self-driving cars, flying cars, freight, bikes, scooters, etc.), it and nearly every other extant on-demand labor platform committed to ride-hail and/or delivery. On-demand delivery working conditions are arguably as <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/04/food-delivery-workers-labor-conditions-are-abysmal">horrendous</a> as ride-hail&#8217;s thanks to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/21/its-a-nightmare-couriers-mystified-by-the-algorithms-that-control-their-jobs">opaque and exploitative</a> algorithmic decision-making. In the face of these overwhelming odds, couriers have organized <a href="https://www.curbed.com/article/nyc-delivery-workers.html">revolt</a> after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/14/food-delivery-drivers-valentines-day-strike-deliveroo-uber-eats">revolt</a> after <a href="https://progressive.international/wire/2023-08-02-suicide-debt-control-and-resistance-stories-of-platform-drivers-in-indonesia/en">revolt</a> across the world in their fight for dignified working conditions&#8212;but it remains painfully clear that on-demand platforms are winning their war on workers, the general public, labor law, and urban governance itself.</p><div><hr></div><p>As Carolan observed, however, ride-hail and delivery are not the only places where the &#8220;business model&#8221; at the heart of on-demand labor can be applied. </p><p>Over the past few years, <strong>nursing</strong> has emerged as a juicy target for investors and firms eager to liberate entire industries of antiquated regulatory frameworks. Last month, the Roosevelt Institute published <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/uber-for-nursing/">a great report</a> on what the application of the on-demand model will mean for nurses and it paints a grim picture. While some hail the emergence of an "Uber for nursing" model as a salve for our nursing shortage, Katie J. Wells and Funda Ustek Spilda detail how these apps reliably degrade working conditions, wages, and care standards.</p><blockquote><p>These apps encourage nurses to work for less pay, fail to provide certainty about scheduling and the amount or nature of work, take little to no accountability for worker safety, and can threaten patient well-being by placing nurses in unfamiliar clinical environments with no onboarding or facility training. On-demand nursing platforms are also using the Uber playbook to lobby state legislatures in an attempt to exempt themselves from existing labor regulations.</p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll be going through the report section by section to highlight key points as I think the report is phenomenal, but I encourage you to read it in full (linked above). </p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The premise of the &#8220;Uber for nursing&#8221; apps is relatively simple: lets use algorithmic systems to managing the scheduling, staffing, and management at medical facilities. For understaffed workplaces looking to cut costs and corners, this is attractive. For nurses and nursing assistants who want more control over their work, this is attractive. But this is especially enticing for investors who drool anytime a firm compares itself to Uber. Take ShiftMed&#8212;one of the darlings of this sector and a subject of the Roosevelt Institute report&#8212;which has raised hundreds of millions (but declines to share its valuation): $47 million in a May 2024 venture round, $200 million in a February 2023 round, $45 million in October 2021, and an early $6 million boost in an August 2019 round. What concretely are firms like ShiftMed offering to draw financing like this?</p><blockquote><p>After a nurse downloads an on-demand nursing app and submits the requisite documents, they can use the app to indicate their interest in a 6-, 8-, or 12-hour shift at a hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, surgical center, dental office, or, in some states, correctional facilities. An algorithmic scheduling software program, which is the heart of these new companies, then approves the worker for a shift, notifies both the medical facility and the worker, allows the worker to clock in and out, and, finally, sends a paycheck.</p><p>The on-demand nursing industry promises hospitals and medical administrators a different set of controls, namely the capacity to seamlessly staff facilities, reduce manager workloads, and lower labor costs.</p></blockquote><p>On paper, this sounds lovely&#8212;the digital disruption of an old rickety system full of middlemen, inefficiencies, misallocation, overcharging, yadda yadda ya. But what&#8217;s the reality on the ground? Wells and Spilda found:</p><blockquote><p>serious safety and health risks for workers and patients. The nurses and nursing assistants who use these apps must <strong>pay fees to bid on shifts</strong>, and they win those bids by <strong>offering to work for lower hourly rates than their fellow workers</strong>. Poor internet or cell service in rural areas can cause the apps to fail, resulting in <strong>missed paychecks for work performed</strong>. These apps also rate the nurses they hire based on facility feedback and <strong>internal algorithmic determinations</strong>. If a worker must cancel a shift due to sickness or personal conflict, their rating goes down, and they often <strong>lose out on future shifts or can be banned from the app altogether</strong>. In at least one case, a nursing assistant went into work at a hospital while sick with COVID-19 because <strong>she could not figure out how to cancel a shift without lowering her rating</strong>. At most hospitals and medical facilities, no orientations are required for gig nurses and nursing assistants. <strong>Workers do not know where supply closets are located, how to access patient portals with medical histories and current medication lists, and whom to contact in the chain of command.</strong> With gig nursing, there is often little to no continuity of care. Despite hospitals&#8217; attempts to automate nursing, care work is inherently tricky to de-skill and predict. Shifts do not neatly end when the apps say they do as, of course, patients&#8217; health-care needs do not end just because the clock says they should. <strong>Human frailty&#8212;the essential subject of nursing&#8212;defies algorithmic management.</strong></p></blockquote><p>As the report will detail, gig nursing has already proven itself to be an unmitigated disaster and we are still relatively early in its assault on our lethargic healthcare system.</p><h2>Background</h2><h3>A Shortage of Decent Workplaces</h3><p>Press them hard enough and most gig nursing firms will insist their raison d'&#234;tre is a desire to fix America&#8217;s nursing shortage by making it easier to for understaffed facilities and underworked nurses to find one another. We do not actually have a nursing shortage, however. There are 187,000 open nursing jobs,  1.7 million registered nurses who are not employed, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) predicts that by 2030 we&#8217;ll see 43 US States with a surplus of registered nurses. Despite this, nurses almost universally report &#8220;moderate to severe&#8221; levels of understaffing and HH has found &#8220;monumental&#8221; staffing issue at nursing home. So what&#8217;s the actual problem? Wells and Splinda write:</p><blockquote><p>The problem, then, is not a shortage of available nurses and nursing assistants, explains Karen Lasater (2024). The problem is a growing number of nurses and nursing assistants who refuse to accept chronically understaffed, underpaid, unsafe, and high-stress workplaces (Muir et al. 2024). In other words, many nurses are <em>not </em>unwilling to work or unwilling to work full-time; they are simply unwilling to work with hazardous conditions, organizational failures, ill-maintained facilities, scheduling rigidity, and low pay (Muir et al. 2024; Lasater et al. 2024). During the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 100,000 registered nurses left the industry due to workplace stresses (Seow 2023; Auerbach et al. 2024). But this pandemic-induced exodus of mostly older workers was more than made up for by the arrival of younger workers, and the nursing workforce has not suffered any long-term shrinkage post-pandemic (Auerbach et al. 2024).</p></blockquote><p>So what&#8217;s driving the shortage of decent workplaces? </p><blockquote><p>Over the last 50 years, financialization, consolidations, and the rise of business administrators in medicine have built a new for-profit health-care empire organized around capital-intensive procedures, consolidated corporate power, and risk-intensive working conditions. In 1965, there were nearly no investor-owned hospitals in the US. But by the mid-1980s, about 15 percent of all US hospitals were owned by investors (Ermann and Gabel 1986). Forty years later, the percentage of investor-owned, for-profit hospitals had nearly doubled to 30 percent of community hospitals in 2022 (Lingel et al. 2022). Alongside this expansion of corporate ownership in the health-care industry, hospital profits ballooned by 411 percent from 1999 to an all-time high of $88 billion in 2017 (National Nurses United 2020). At the same time, rural areas have seen more than 100 hospitals close in the last decade and 700 more at risk of imminent closure (Olsen 2024). New management practices such as decreased lengths of stay for patients and increased responsibilities for nurses have taken hold across the health-care industry (Brewer 1998). Business endeavors to cut costs have kept nursing wages stagnant and led to an increasing number of medical facilities that are purposefully understaffed (Brewer 1998).</p></blockquote><p>All of this has only grown even worse with the ascent of private equity, a type of capitalist parasite that leverages $$$ to buy up then restructure a business for the maximum possible return. One quick and vivid explanation of private equity can be found in Yanis Varoufakis' "Technofeudalism" where he uses an English private care provider acquired by a private equity firm as the example. The worker (Gillian) may not notice much at first, but behind the scenes the company has been split into two: CareCom, a care service provider that employs Gillian and her co-workers; and PropCom, which now owns all of hte property (buildings, equipment, vans, etc.) and charges CareCom for their use. PropCom not only hikes the rents it charges CareCom, but promises further hikes. CareCom's managers tell CareCom&#8217;s workers that they must accept longer working hours for no extra pay lest CareCom go under. PropCom goes to the bank and offers up its predatory rent scheme revenues as collateral for a big loan, then uses the loan to payout dividends to its shareholders. </p><p>This can only continue for so long, however, and in five years time CareCom goes belly up. Gillian and her co-workers are finally fired, but only after conditions and pay degraded substantially. And the communities which were promised care&#8212;paid for in advance with their taxes&#8212;are left royally fucked. PropCom, however, is doing better than ever. They'll sell off the property at a profit, pay back the loan from the bank, and pocket the difference (for their investors, of course). This is "straightforward asset-stripping" as Varoufakis explains&#8212;looting by financiers that is legal for some reason (and given a fancy-sounding name "dividend recapitalisation").</p><p>The same thing happens here, as Wells and Splinda write:</p><blockquote><p>Private equity&#8217;s acquisition and subsequent raiding of two of the largest health-care staffing agencies in the country is an important piece of any story about why so many nurses turn to gig nursing. When the private equity companies Ares Management and Leonard Green and Partners acquired a majority stake in CHG Healthcare, a health-care staffing agency, the private equity companies did two things. First, they followed a routine private equity move of adding hundreds of millions of new debt to the staffing agency as a way to finance the acquisitions of other companies. Then, they extracted more than $1.5 billion in dividends from the staffing agency. Not long after, Moody&#8217;s lowered CHG&#8217;s credit rating from stable to negative. Just as private equity is looting and closing hospitals across the country, so too is it raiding travel nursing agencies (Bugbee 2022).</p></blockquote><p>Gig nursing firms have not attracted significant funding because there is a nursing shortage, they&#8217;ve attracted significant funding because financialization has devastated our healthcare system in pursuit of excessive returns and other financiers are eager to replicate this destructive model of large private profits and even larger socialized losses.</p><h3>Existing Research on Gig Nursing</h3><p>Across the body of work looking at the impact of gig nursing and algorithmic management, there is little room for interpretation: the only true beneficiaries are the investors financing this clear attack on the quality of care provided by and working conditions of the US healthcare system. Wells and Splinda cite a study of the gig nursing industry by Chia Yu Lien and write:</p><blockquote><p>Lien does not mince words: Gig nursing services have worsened, rather than alleviated, the quality and quantity of nursing jobs. In using gig nursing services, nursing home managers make a Faustian bargain: To offset the premium costs for gig nurses (who often command higher rates than in-house staff), a nursing home takes in more clients, resulting in more work for its employed staff. Employed staff then find &#8220;themselves receiving lower salaries, having higher caseloads, working on weekends and holidays and often providing extra services for which they [are] not compensated.&#8221; Lien concludes that gig nursing jobs hurt the quality of care in health-care facilities, ignite workplace tensions between gig nurses and full-time staff, and eliminate much-needed managerial oversight in these facilities.</p></blockquote><p>Other research raises similar concerns: gig nursing degrades quality of care because it is not continuous,  erodes worker rights, externalizes various risks from employers to app-based workers, and reinforces existing inequities in the name of cost-cutting.</p><h3>A Brief Labor History</h3><p>While algorithmically-mediated gig nursing platforms for medical facilities are a novel development, Wells and Splinda&#8217;s map out in this section how the use of third-party staffing entities is not novel in the industry. Until the 1950s, in fact, most nurses working at hospitals did it through women-run private-duty registries that organized collective agreements for nurse employment and allowed for pay, schedule, and working condition negotiation. Once hospitals began to hire and manage staff nurses from their own pools, the registry system (and its working conditions) quickly met its demise. Hospitals would also go on to intervene in policy debates, distracting from quality-of-workplace issues raised by nurses to instead push for the government to expand nursing education. As Wells and Splinda put it &#8220;Rather than asking why so many nurses had left their jobs in the 1950s, federal action focused on increasing the supply of new nurses to take open spots or using student nurses who would toil long hours for little to no pay.&#8221; The tension between nurses in workplaces with collectively-enforced standards and attempts to atomize workers such that they&#8217;re easier (and cheaper) to manage/schedule:</p><blockquote><p>In recent years, a number of campaigns by unionized nurses have made important contributions to the labor movement by demanding decent patient care (Hirsch et al. 2024; Krachler et al. 2021; but see Givan 2016 on the fraught relationship between labor movements and nurses). National Nurses United, the largest union for registered nurses, held a June 2022 webinar on the topic of gig nursing and later warned that gig nursing firms will harm all nurses in the long run (National Nurses United n.d.; Coleman-Lochner 2023). However, when the union released in 2024 a guiding set of principles &#8220;for AI Justice in Nursing and Health Care,&#8221; the issue of gig nursing did not appear. Initial research suggests that gig nursing is most common in nonunionized medical facilities, which may contribute to the smaller amount of attention the issue has received so far from existing unions, whose workplace concerns for employed nurses are already considerable.</p></blockquote><h2>Worker Experiences</h2><h4>The Black Box of On-Demand Nursing Apps</h4><p>Here we get to some of the personal testimonies which are frustrating, to say the least. </p><blockquote><p>In the gig nursing world, there is zero transparency about how jobs are algorithmically allocated or automatically scheduled. Different shifts will show up on different workers&#8217; phones&#8212;often for different amounts of pay. On the same day, at the same hour, in the same hospital, two different gig nurses can be paid different amounts by the same app. The gig nursing industry looks more like a black box than a clear process or a fair set of rules. The industry&#8217;s opaque and personalized pay structures create what Veena Dubal (2023) terms &#8220;algorithmic wage discrimination,&#8221; a kind of discrimination in which workers are paid different hourly amounts based on ever-changing calculations and informational asymmetries. <strong>Gig nursing apps may determine pay by what the firm knows about how much a nurse was willing to accept for a previous assignment, how often they bid for shifts, or how much credit card or other kinds of debt they might hold. </strong>These uncertainties combine to create frustrating and precarious conditions for the workers who rely on these apps.</p></blockquote><p>Wells and Splinda go on to highlight that gig nurses are not only expected to always be on call, but hospitals can suddenly cancel, shorten, or extend their shifts with little to no notice&#8212;nurses would be penalized if they tried to do the same on their end, however:</p><blockquote><p>For Dana, a 29-year-old nurse in St. Louis, Missouri, one of the hardest parts of working on the CareRev app is not knowing whether she will actually get to work a shift that she accepted. Even after she is matched with a shift at a nearby hospital and arranges childcare for her son, she won&#8217;t know for sure if she&#8217;ll be able to earn money that day. She says, &#8220;It&#8217;s a gamble . . . I&#8217;ll wake up at 5:00 in the morning and I&#8217;ll find out if I&#8217;m canceled or not.&#8221;8 If a hospital cancels her shift more than two hours before the start time, CareRev does not compensate her at all. If the cancellation is closer to the planned start time, she sometimes earns two to four hours of what she was supposed to have earned if she worked the entire shift. Hospitals may also shorten shifts while a nurse is on the job; in these cases, the app does not pay the nurse for any of the unworked hours. (Of course, nurses are not paid for any unexpected additional hours they may work.) If Dana were to cancel a shift at the last minute or leave in the middle of a shift, she would be penalized. Her attendance rating would dip, which would negatively impact her access to future shifts or the app itself.</p><p>To work on the CareRev app, Dana must be on-call for all of the shifts she selects but is only paid for her actual hours worked. Almost all of the workers we interviewed shared frustrations about the way gig nursing companies do not compensate nurses for canceled or shortened shifts. Several workers described with resentment the experience of receiving a cancellation notice in the app just as they arrive at a facility&#8217;s parking lot. When this happened to Robin, a 41-year-old health-care worker living near Miami, Florida, she couldn&#8217;t find another shift and did not work that day.</p></blockquote><p>On top of all this, gig nurses are not given equal pay for equal work!!</p><blockquote><p>On ShiftKey, Ashley not only expresses her availability for a shift but bids for one against peers by indicating the lowest hourly rate for which she will work. To win the shift, she lowers and lowers her rate until it&#8217;s well below a living wage. Like other gig workers who spend a considerable amount of work time not being paid (see Attoh et al. 2024), Ashley is not paid for the time she spends each month updating her profile, reviewing available positions, bidding for shifts, and sending messages in the app about errors in her wages.</p></blockquote><p>Ashley earns an average of $23 per hour on ShiftKey, but arbitrarily pays $6 per shift in hidden fees</p><blockquote><p>Each day Ashley works, she is required to pay $3.67 for a &#8220;safety fee&#8221; (which the company describes as &#8220;costs associated with background checks, drug screens [if applicable], verification of credentials, and fraud detection and prevention&#8221;), $2.14 for occupational accident insurance, and $0.21 for medical malpractice insurance (ShiftKey 2024b; 2024c). <strong>It is not clear why these fees are priced per day, given that nurses do not get background checks or drug screens each day they work on the app.</strong> By the end of 2024, these fees will increase to a new total of $7 per shift. Ashley is also charged $2 per shift if she elects to cash out immediately rather than waiting a week for her pay to be transferred. </p></blockquote><p>And while the rates on ShiftKey can be higher than what traditionally employed nurses and nursing assistants earn, this does not account for &#8220;material expenses&#8221;:</p><blockquote><p>such as equipment, licenses, and uniforms, for which workers are responsible. Gig nurses, for instance, must pay for and maintain differently colored scrubs (and sometimes shoes) for different facilities. Moreover, the payout does not account for the significant payroll taxes for which workers are responsible. ShiftMed is a welcome outlier in this regard as it treats its workers as W-2 employees with some basic labor rights.</p></blockquote><p>So gig nursing empowers employers to misclassify care workers&#8212;this frees those workers from the protection of various local, state, and federal labor laws, as well as the employers from the costs of providing materials and adequate wages. It also empowers the middlemen, these gig nursing platforms, to scalp each shift with hidden fees that push wages down and conditions into the shitter.</p><blockquote><p>When companies like CareRev, ShiftKey, and Clipboard Health classify nurses and nursing assistants as self-employed, many of the costs and risks of doing business are shifted onto the workers. These workers are excluded from the protections of local, state, and federal law on minimum wage, overtime pay, workers&#8217; compensation, retirement benefits, employment-based health insurance, and paid sick days.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Safety and Health Risks for Workers</strong></h3><p>One theme that is painfully obvious in this section is the extent to which there is overlap with app-based delivery work, namely how unsafe it leaves the workers:</p><blockquote><p>Aisha compares the risks of gig nursing work to those of app-based food delivery, which often takes her to strange neighborhoods at night. For ShiftKey, she has shown up late at night to facilities where the doors are locked and she can&#8217;t get in contact with anyone to open them. Even inside certain hospitals or nursing homes, she sometimes feels unsafe: &#8220;You really don&#8217;t know anything about the facilities.&#8221; Gig nurses are not required to complete any paid training or onboarding at most facilities. They are dropped into facilities like new avatars in a survivalist video game. The result of gig nurses&#8217; isolation isn&#8217;t just a lack of solidarity with peers (be it other gig workers or employed staff) but exclusion from any sort of professional development or professional culture that maintains shared norms and practices.</p></blockquote><p>There is little to no supervision offered by the facilities or the gig nursing companies. Instead of phone numbers, gig nurses are expected to communicate with chatbots if questions or concerns arise during a shift. Because facilities are often poorly run and desperate enough to use these firms, gig nurses bring their own vitals equipment because they aren&#8217;t sure the facility will have any. And because these facilities tend to be understaffed due to horrendous working conditions, gig nurses are expected to work that would normally be divided between multiple people but for no extra pay.  To make matters worse, antagonism emerges between gig nurses and any regular staff present that assumes these on-demand workers are earning more for equal work.</p><blockquote><p>As a reminder, gig nurses and gig nursing assistants are often paid higher wages per hour than employed staff, but, unlike most employed staff, are responsible for significant expenses and earn no benefits.</p></blockquote><p>As most of the existing body of research on gig work across industries points out, this sort of antagonism not only undermines the capacity for solidarity between gig workers as well as across worker classifications but is exploited by on-demand labor platforms to keep workers too isolated, atomized, and vulnerable to collectively challenge such abysmal conditions.</p><h3><strong>Safety and Health Risks for Patients</strong></h3><p>Workers aren&#8217;t the only ones who are hurt by gig nursing, however. Take Shakayla, a 38 year old nurse in Los Angeles:</p><blockquote><p>For the last year, she has picked up shifts using ShiftMed to supplement her income as a regular travel nurse for a health-care staffing agency. The difference between the kinds of facilities where she works as a travel nurse and a gig nurse are stark. On ShiftMed shifts, she says: &#8220;There have been times when I&#8217;ve been unable to access patient records or find supply closets.&#8221;25 There are also broken machines and missing equipment, she says. By contrast, &#8220;You go to a hospital in a different area that has funds and resources . . . It&#8217;s just like night and day, honestly.&#8221; Shakayla likes the stability, benefits, and rapport with her coworkers at her regular job and dislikes how work booked through ShiftMed can pose risks to patient safety, but inflation and increases in the cost of living mean that she keeps opening the ShiftMed app.</p></blockquote><p>As highlighted in earlier sections, gig nursing&#8217;s core model is incompatible with continuous care. No matter what gig nursing platforms might argue, quality care cannot be discontinuous. When it is, we see major lapses in care: inconsistent updates on patient medication, treatment or assistance that patients need, whether controlled substances are adequately secured, and so on.</p><h3><strong>Gig Nursing Retention</strong></h3><p>One of the key takeaways here for Wells and Splinda is that even though the gig nursing sector is dominated by such poor working conditions and such high risk to patients and nurses, it is still pursued by nurses who need flexible schedules. Why?</p><blockquote><p>The fact that many workers are willing to take on the risks of the health-care sector via unregulated technology should be a reflection of the failures of the existing labor market in general and the erosion of labor standards in the health-care industry in particular&#8212;not merely the design failures of gig nursing. In other words, the risks and concerns that workers expressed will not be automated away if the current algorithmic systems are replaced by better ones and trained on more data with more use cases. For many workers, the possibility of employment that involves flexible schedules is enticing and worth pursuing. The question before civic leaders and government officials is how to balance the flexibility that attracts gig nurses while also addressing the workplace concerns of those same workers and patients who need care.</p></blockquote><h2><strong>Policy Landscape</strong></h2><p>On the policy side, Uber opened the door and gig nursing platforms will eagerly run through it. </p><blockquote><p>Since 2022, a number of laws and legal amendments have been drafted to define digitally dispatched health-care workers as independent contractors. Just as Uber convinced municipal regulators in 2012 that digitally dispatched chauffeurs needed a new business category and exemptions from existing regulatory structures, so too are on-demand nursing companies trying to convince state-level regulators that there is something magically different about their business operations and thus they should be exempted from existing legislation. </p></blockquote><p>In California, Minnesota, and Ohio, we see attempts to push through laws that self-exempt gig nursing platforms from labor laws&#8212;thankfully they&#8217;ve all failed. In 2022, however, Colorado adopted an industry-friendly gig nursing bill that will likely serve as a model in the years to come.</p><blockquote><p>This new Colorado law tries to preempt both local regulation and the kinds of misclassification lawsuits that have entangled ShiftKey and Clipboard Health. In several states, ShiftKey workers contend that nursing homes have wrongly withheld their wages and overtime pay. What&#8217;s important to keep in mind about these legal battles is that the cases are not being brought directly against ShiftKey. The workers, who are prevented from filing class action lawsuits, are suing the nursing homes that treated them as employees (i.e., asked workers to stay late) but did not compensate them as such with overtime pay (Henreckson 2024). Of course, ShiftKey, as the entity that facilitates the recruitment, hiring, and scheduling of these workers, is implicated in the cases. In California, Clipboard Health has seen numerous wage claims filed against it and, in 2022, agreed to a $2.2 million settlement over unpaid overtime to its workers (Sumagaysay 2023).</p></blockquote><p>And an important point emphasized by Wells and Splinda is that such regulatory arbitrage encourages more because firms that try to do the right thing are actually at a competitive disadvantage. Firms that, say, &#8220;avoid contributions to social programs and force the public to pay for essential services for their workforce&#8221; are more likely to attract investors (or able themselves to finance expansion) than those that pay fair wages and contribute to Social Security or unemployment or health insurance. Still, classification as employees will not fix every issue as the gig nursing model itself comes into conflict with the very nature of quality healthcare.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><blockquote><p>Across the US, gig companies present themselves as quick fixes to what many have argued are really structural problems in the contemporary health-care industry. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, companies like ShiftKey, Clipboard Health, CareRev, and ShiftMed have seized an opportunity and appealed to our common sense. Just as the gig economy sold itself as offering workers some control over their lives, gig nursing companies promise to empower nurses. As such, we must see the rise of on-demand nursing as a symptom of a problem&#8212;not the problem itself. Nursing professor Karen Lasater (2024) is explicit:</p><p>Policymakers need not solve for a low workforce supply issue; the US has a robust and growing supply of registered nurses with enough new nurses to more than replace retiring nurses through 2035. Instead, policies are needed to address the low retention caused by employers&#8217; chronic understaffing, rigid scheduling options, and lack of responsiveness to clinicians&#8217; recommendations to improve care, which drives nurses to burnout and [to] depart for better working conditions.</p></blockquote><p>Is gig nursing the solution to our dysfunctional healthcare system? Certainly not. If anything, the report details the ways in which it ignores every key issue, exacerbates existing ones, and creates novel ones as well, at great cost to everyone except employers and financiers whose interests have little to do with public health.</p><blockquote><p>On-demand nursing companies exercise employer-like control over their workers yet ascribe to workers a &#8220;second-class status of nonemployees&#8221; (Sherer and Poydock 2023). These companies want the power that comes with being an employer while disowning the duties and responsibilities enacted over the past century by federal and state lawmakers. The companies, however, frame the question of worker misclassification not as an issue of eroded labor rights but as a referendum on freedom, empowerment, and progress.</p></blockquote><p>Often the deployment of new technology is used as cover to rollback reforms and regulations that have made old levels of profiteering unrealizable or outright illegal. That tends to be a function of who is steering the design, development, and deployment of said technologies. It is one thing when managers and financiers are in the drivers seat, and it would be another thing entirely if care workers were in control. It is not clear to me why anyone other than nurses should be in control of what sort of technology is introduced into their workplaces, how this technology is designed, why it is deployed, and when it is used. To close out with Wells and Splinda:</p><blockquote><p>It is important to not lose sight of the enormous amount of skill, coordination, understanding of human vulnerability and frailty, and treatment of patients with utmost decency required to provide good quality care. Technology could provide solutions to automate and unburden the nurses and health-care workers from the everyday management tasks of their work; however, decision-making around such solutions should include the nurses themselves, from design to deployment.</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Hello! First off, I want to thank you for supporting the newsletter with your subscription. It has meant more than I can express and has been helpful as I get <em>The Tech Bubble</em> up and running. My first few paywalled posts will be sporadic until later this year, but hearing Trump invoke MLK&#8217;s name reminded me of the very first essay I wrote online when I was 18 over at <em>Genius</em> (formerly known as <em>Rap Genius</em>, RIP): a screed about the whitewashing of MLK&#8217;s radical dissent. </p><p>I doubt there will ever be a day where King&#8217;s work is not relevant&#8212;the empire he died organizing against still reigns supreme over the world. I wrote this essay so long ago I feel less embarrassment than surprise, in fact I feel a little amusement because I recognize some of the rhetorical flourishes and writing tics that&#8217;ve stuck with me to this day. </p><p><a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/the-second-assassination-of-martin">

It may be hard to believe, but my foray into CES suggests the tech sector is getting even more removed from reality than its temporary host city.</p><p>I love Las Vegas because it is one of the more honest expressions of what it means to be an American: desperately scrambling to silence the occasional stirring of what passes for a soul in this country. And, yes, the city is very fun when you don&#8217;t have a Protestant upbringing buzzing in your ear (e.g. all the food, alcohol, drugs, strip clubs, parties, dayclubs, nightclubs, spectacles, desert adventures, and gambling you could want), but only if you don&#8217;t think too hard about it. </p><p>If you think about it, though, you end up in a dark place! Even before the Supreme Court struck down the federal prohibition on sports gambling in 2018, however, it was clear where we were headed. Take a 2017 Chris Hedges <em><a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/a-nation-of-the-walking-dead/">Truthdig</a></em><a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/a-nation-of-the-walking-dead/"> column</a>, in which he argues that a culture as committed as ours to gambling is one committed to numbing and killing itself by any means necessary: </p><blockquote><p>Roger Caillois, the French sociologist, wrote that the pathologies of a culture are captured in the games the culture venerates. Old forms of gambling such as blackjack and poker allowed the gambler to take risks, make decisions and even, in his or her mind, achieve a kind of individualism or heroism at the gambling table. They provided a way, it can be argued, to assert an alternative identity for a brief moment. But the newer form, machine gambling, is an erasure of the self. Slot machines, which produce 85 percent of the profits at casinos, are, as the sociologist Henry Lesieur wrote, an &#8220;addiction delivery device.&#8221; They are &#8220;electronic morphine,&#8221; &#8220;the crack cocaine of gambling.&#8221; They are not about risk or about making decisions, but about creating somnambulism, putting a player into a trancelike state that can last for hours. It is a pathway, as sociologist Natasha Dow Sch&#252;ll points out, to becoming the walking dead. This yearning for a state of nonbeing is what Sigmund Freud called &#8220;the death instinct.&#8221; It is the overpowering drive by a depressed and traumatized person to seek pleasure in a self-destructive activity that ultimately kills the organism.</p></blockquote><p>Hedges&#8217; column starts by talking about addiction as of 2017: the United States consumes the vast majority of opioids used worldwide, sees tens of thousands die from overdoses, spends tens of billions on painkillers, lets millions suffer from alcohol abuse, and spends well over $100 billion on heroin, methamphetamines, cocaine, and weed. These are sums eclipsed by gambling. Here are the numbers (again from 2017):</p><blockquote><p>Americans in 2013 <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/451623/how-did-americans-manage-lose-119-billion-gambling-last-year">lost $119 billion gambling</a>, with an additional $70 billion&#8212;or $300 for every adult in the country&#8212;spent on lottery tickets.</p><p>Federal and state governments, reliant on tax revenues from legal gambling and on lottery ticket sales, will do nothing to halt the expansion of the industry or the economic and psychological toll it exacts on those in financial distress. State-run lottery games had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/your-money/the-billion-dollar-lottery-jackpot-engineered-to-drain-your-wallet.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FLotteries&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=1%20">sales of $73.9 billion</a> in 2015, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. This revenue is vital to budgets beset by declining incomes, deindustrialization and austerity. &#8220;State lotteries provided more revenue than state corporate-income taxes in 11 of the 43 states where they were legal, including Delaware, Rhode Island, and South Dakota,&#8221; Derek Thompson <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/lotteries-americas-70-billion-shame/392870/%20">wrote in The Atlantic.</a> &#8220;The poorest third of households buy half of all lotto tickets,&#8221; he noted. Gambling is a stealth tax on poor people hoping to beat the nearly impossible odds. Governmental income from gambling is an effort to make up for the taxes the rich and corporations no longer pay.</p></blockquote><p>Hedges sees these machines, casinos, and gambling more generally as finely tuned to "cater to the longing to flee from the oppressive world of dead-end jobs, crippling debt and social stagnation and a dysfunctional political system." To make his case, he leans heavily on Natasha Sch&#252;ll, citing <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691160887/addiction-by-design">her landmark study of machine gambling</a> in Las Vegas (&#8220;Addiction by Design&#8221;). On close examination, gamblers are less addicted to winning than to the "world-dissolving state of subjective suspension and affective calm" that machine play offers. The shape and feel of consoles and seats, the displays and interfaces, the acoustics of the floor, the lack of natural sunlight, these and much more are engineered to maximize &#8220;time on device&#8221; and thus the casino&#8217;s profits. To further that end, casinos engage in an impressive array of surveillance to track gamblers, construct personal profiles, kick out winners, and determine the breaking points of losers&#8212;intervening just before they leave so that time on device can be maximized. </p><p>Because of the extensive data collection involved in <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/security/how-to/a5226/4341499/">managing a casino</a> (i.e. ensuring gamblers are losing as much as possible), casinos have also functioned as a testing grounds for other industries interested in surveillance. Sch&#252;ll names "airports, financial trading floors, consumer shopping malls, insurance agencies, banks, and government programs like Homeland Security" as just some of the beneficiaries of Las Vegas's technological innovation. </p><p>In a conversation with Hedges, Sch&#252;ll doesn&#8217;t mince words:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;When you look at contemporary slot machines, they don&#8217;t operate on volatility,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;One designer of the mathematics and algorithm of these games said we want an algorithm that makes you feel like you are reclining on a couch. The curves, architecture and the softly pixelated lights, they want you to sit back and go with the flow. I just couldn&#8217;t make sense of that for the longest time in my research. Gamblers would say, &#8216;It&#8217;s so weird, but sometimes when I win a big jackpot I feel angry and frustrated.&#8217; What they&#8217;re playing for is not to win, but to stay in the zone. Winning disrupts that because suddenly the machine is frozen, it&#8217;s not letting you keep going. What are you going to do with that winning anyway? You&#8217;re just going to feed it back into the machines. This is more about mood modulation. Affect modulation. Using technologies to dampen anxieties and exit the world. We don&#8217;t just see it in Las Vegas. We see it in the subways every morning. The rise of all of these screen-based technologies and the little games that we&#8217;ve all become so absorbed in. What gamblers articulate is a desire to really lose a sense of self. They lose time, space, money value, and a sense of being in the world. What is that about? What does that say? How do we diagnose that?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the flip side to the incredible pressure, which is experienced as a burden, to self-manage, to make choices, to always be maximizing as you&#8217;re living life in this entrepreneurial mode,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We talk about this as the subjective side of the neoliberal agenda, where pressure is put on individuals to regulate themselves. In this case, they are regulating themselves, but they are regulating themselves away from that. This really is a mode of escape. It&#8217;s not action gambling. This is escape gambling. You can see it on their faces. The consequences and ethics are distasteful. It&#8217;s predatory. It&#8217;s predation on a type of escape where people are driven to exit the world. They&#8217;re not trying to win. The casinos are trying to win. They are trying to make revenue. They&#8217;re kind of in a partnership with the gamblers, but it&#8217;s a very asymmetrical partnership. The gamblers don&#8217;t want to win. They want to just keep going. Some people have likened gamblers to factory workers who are alienated by the machine. I don&#8217;t see it that way. This is more about machines designed to synchronize with what you want&#8212;in this case escape&#8212;and [to] profit from that.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>This, Hedges argues, will be the building block of our future politics: perpetual immiseration obscured by public-private partnerships to build digitally mediated pleasure palaces, alongside robust efforts to improve access to various opioids and soma, and reinforced with a healthy dose of outright force when we step out of line. After CES, I think this vision doubles as a diagram that connects gambling and Vegas (as a laboratory of odious technologies of surveillance and social control and extraction and immiseration across society) to CES (as a place to fine tune hype narratives obfuscating the scramble for these tools) to capitalist technology and our political-economic order.</p><div><hr></div><p>On Gambling</p><p>It may have been unleashed by the Supreme Court&#8217;s 2018 decision, but as I wrote in 2021 it was partly <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-economy-is-back-welcome-to-the-casino/">supercharged by the Covid-19 pandemic:</a> speculative finance bullshit proliferated thanks to &#8220;fintech&#8221; that reduced barriers to losing money on stocks, crypto, and NFTs; more traditional finance bullshit in the form of SPACs; the aggressive lobbying by the gambling industry to set up online casinos, <a href="https://www.ftm.eu/articles/stake-questionable-gambling-on-curacao">influencer gamblers targeting children</a>, app-based sports gambling, and closer ties between sports leagues and gambling outfits. </p><p>In 2022, Jay Caspian Kang <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/07/opinion/legalized-gambling-addiction.html">wrote</a> in his <em>New York Times</em> column that while he doubted this wave of sports betting legalization would lead to a "long-term epidemic of problem gambling&#8221; he was concerned that "he could &#8220;no longer really tell the difference between buying cryptocurrencies, betting on sports or trading stocks&#8221; because they&#8217;ve become part of a &#8220;mega gamble with payouts that could change your life.&#8221; Kang offers an agnostic version of Hedges&#8217; theory at one point: we shouldn&#8217;t read too much into the firms behind this gambling boom because they&#8217;re simply &#8220;doing whatever it takes to maximize their user bases and profits&#8221; but at the same time one can&#8217;t shake the fear that it &#8220;it reflects a desperation in today&#8217;s youth&#8221; made worse by the pandemic. Is this true?</p><p>When arguing that gambling was an outgrowth of a culture gripped by despair, corporate predation, and addiction by design, Hedges painted a pretty dire picture in 2017. How do things look today? <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/07/remember-the-opioid-crisis-new-study-finds-its-only-gotten-worse/">The opioid crisis has gotten worse.</a> Opioid overdose deaths <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates">grew</a> to 81,806 by 2022 before starting to decline to an estimated 75,091 deaths in 2024. Painkillers were a $24 billion global market in 2015 and grew to $81 billion in 2023&#8212;the global opioid market is now <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/opioids-market">about $23 billion</a>, the United States accounting for <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/north-america-opioid-market#:~:text=The%20global%20North%20America%20opioids,USD%2014.95%20billion%20in%202023.">$14.5 billion</a>. Annual expenditures for marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, and heroin grew from <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kilmer-United-States-final-2.pdf">$100 billion</a> (across the 2000s) to almost <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3140.html">$150 billion</a> (by 2016), with weed&#8217;s market ($52 billion) becoming as large as coke&#8217;s ($24 billion) and meth&#8217;s ($27 billion) <em>combined</em>, while heroin&#8217;s market ($43 billion) grew to be the largest behind weed. Alcohol abuse has grown from 14 million adults to <a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-use-disorder-aud-united-states-age-groups-and-demographic-characteristics">28 million</a>. Legal sports gambling hit <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/american-gaming-association-legal-sports-betting-hits-record-revenue-in-2023-80522087">$119 billion</a> in 2023 and an estimated <a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/218449/2024-us-sports-betting-revenue/">$150 billion</a> in 2024. Illegal sports betting&#8212;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/09/12/sports-betting-offshore-black-market/">which legalization was supposed to end</a>&#8212;has metasized into a <a href="https://www.americangaming.org/resources/sizing-the-illegal-and-unregulated-gaming-markets-in-the-u-s/">$64 billion</a> market (this does not include the much larger $337 billion illegal online gambling market). A recent study <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4903302">found</a> that sports betting increases a household&#8217;s likelihood of bankruptcy by 30 percent. Lottery sales have grown from $70 billion to <a href="https://www.naspl.org/faq">$113 billion</a> for FY 2024. In 2009, lotteries provided more revenue than revenue than corporate income taxes in 11 states&#8212;in 2022, this was true of <a href="https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/07/01/state-lotteries-transfer-wealth/">10 states</a>. A 2024 analysis by <em>The Economist</em><a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/04/02/the-economics-of-american-lotteries">found</a> that the poorest households spend about 33 times more on lottery tickets than the richest households. And while lotteries are totted as a way to finance state aid for low-income residents, a <em><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/17/metro/mass-lotto-fails-some-cities/">Boston Globe</a></em><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/17/metro/mass-lotto-fails-some-cities/"> investigation</a> showed this couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth in Massachusetts, the state with the highest per capita spending on lottery tickets.</p><p>I could go on and on like this but it&#8217;s clear there<strong> has been </strong>a long-term problem when it comes to gambling, both in terms of what is driving its proliferation and the impact of it. Hedges was in right in 2017 and is even more right now: a culture as committed to preying upon and immiserating its most vulnerable citizens as ours turns out to be a culture where people will retreat into various escapes/addictions, such as gambling or substance abuse. From that come a few interlinked points:</p><p>(1) Regressively taxing the consumption of poor individuals is an easier political project to pitch than progressive taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals. The former lack the wealth or power to do anything about social policies that will further disempower and eventually kill them. Or as tech venture capitalist Marc Andreessen <a href="https://prospect.org/power/2024-04-24-my-dinner-with-andreessen/">put it</a> &#8220;I&#8217;m glad there&#8217;s OxyContin and video games to keep those people quiet.&#8221;</p><p>(2) Sans popular pressure or legal advocacy, there&#8217;s not much political interest in seriously holding corporations accountable for preying on, poisoning, or killing poor people beyond fines and offering more sustainably harmful products. Forever chemicals, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/27/3m-forever-chemicals-pfas-pfos-toxic">whose toxicity has been known for decades</a>, poisoned every corner of this planet before the Biden administration <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-first-ever-national-drinking-water-standard">introduced</a> America&#8217;s first national drinking water standard aimed at <em>reducing </em>exposure for upwards of 100 million people.  Johnson &amp; Johnson <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/">knew for decades</a> that the asbestos in its baby powder products was causing cancer, using the courts to <a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/us-doj-challenges-johnson-johnsons-talc-bankruptcy-attempt-texas">evade multi-billion dollar settlements </a>while opening <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/09/19/johnson-johnson-and-a-new-war-on-consumer-protection">a new front on the war against this country&#8217;s threadbare consumer protection laws</a>. (J&amp;J also agreed to pay $5 billion of a $26 billion settlement over its role in fueling the opioid crisis).</p><p>(3) In the 12 years since &#8220;Addiction by Design&#8221; was published, things have changed a bit. In 2019, Kevin Litman-Navarro <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/6973/sports-gambling-coming-to-a-computer-near-you">wrote</a> about a nascent attempt by NBC Sports Washington to create an alternate broadcast that offered "predictive gaming" which enabled bets on every single aspect of the game (halftime score, turnover, dunks, etc.) "Predictive gaming is like fantasy football meets roulette, and if broadcasters adopt techniques perfected by casinos (and adopted by social media sites to keep people engaged, the future of sports gambling could make it a lot more addictive,&#8221; Litman-Navarro warned. In a 2023 talk, Sch&#252;ll <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUeTnQeIFCE&amp;t=1428s">reflects</a> on how online gambling would prove to be even more addictive than casino machines:</p><blockquote><p>It's solitary. It's you and the machine. There's no person interrupting or putting a social temporality on the experience&#8212;it's you and the machine. It's extremely rapid feedback and, again, it's continuous without a set ending. It's potentially never-ending! You could just keep going&#8212;even now in sports-betting, because when a game ends you just switch over to another game on the same app or site. It could be ping-pong in Poland, table tennis in Amsterdam. All of this creates a much deeper psychological engagement than offline sports betting. It feels more like a traditional slot machine in that sense and it's harder to stop.</p></blockquote><p>And to extend our third point, Sch&#252;ll adds that while her book ended with the gambling industry expressing anxiety about its slot machine clientele aging out, online gambling has given them access to incredibly young blood that will make for lifelong customers (an anxiety familiar to the tobacco industry as it <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2788397/">fought to stop older smokers from quitting</a>, then <a href="https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/39/5/daae126/7874887">aggressively targeted young people</a> with &#8220;smokeless&#8221; products to cultivate a new generation of lifelong smokers). </p><p>Weaponized pleasure and hedonic engineering are not new concepts when it comes to <a href="https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/occ_papers/28/">consumer products</a>, nor is the idea that something can be ubiquitous yet designed in a way that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/01/13/why-is-the-american-diet-so-deadly">slowly kills its consumers</a> as profitably as possible. In fact, the usual response to this is <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/harmful-chemicals-removed-from-products-often-replaced-with-something-as-bad-or-worse/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20need%20to%20recognize%20regrettable,of%20us%20knowingly%20signed%20on.%E2%80%9D">&#8220;regrettable substitution&#8221;</a> where the toxic compound or hazardous product is banned, but replaced with something nearly identical. Despite this, people will debate whether the supposed benefits (taxes, recreation, etc.), especially when it comes to gambling. I think it clearly causes more harm than its worth, however! And not just for gambling&#8212;which, again, is intentionally designed to be as addictive as possible with finely tuned physical environments as well as digital technologies <strong>and</strong> has served as a laboratory for tools of surveillance + social control&#8212;but for the multitude of industries and spheres of life that have been touched by gambling and its tech innovations.</p><p>Gambling isn&#8217;t just concerning because it is powered by and advances noxious technologies, but because it is transforming how we engage with life. Nate Silver argues in his book &#8220;On the Edge&#8221; that risk-taking and a progressional gambler&#8217;s mindset are increasingly defining how decisions are made across our society:</p><blockquote><p>The River is a sprawling ecosystem of like-minded people that includes everyone from low-stakes poker pros just trying to grind out a living to crypto kings and venture-capital billionaires. It is a way of thinking and a mode of life. People don&#8217;t know very much about the River, but they should. Most Riverians aren&#8217;t rich and powerful. But rich and powerful people are disproportionately likely to be Riverians compared to the rest of the population.</p></blockquote><p>&#8220;Upriver&#8221; live the rationalists and effective altruists who rub shoulders with crypto and artificial intelligence evangelists. &#8220;Midriver&#8221; is where Silicon Valley and Wall Street investors <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/abolish-venture-capitalism/">seek returns at great cost to the rest of society</a>. &#8220;Downriver&#8221; we find &#8220;lots of tourists and lots of gambling&#8221; as people flock to casino floors and sports books. And just further out we come across the  &#8220;Archipelago&#8221; where &#8220;pretty much anything goes&#8221; &#8212;it&#8217;s here that the &#8220;weakest of the herd&#8221; are picked off by online poker, as well as sports betting and crypto speculation (and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/crypto-casinos-bitcoin-opened-new-online-gambling-world-rcna23062">crypto casinos</a>).</p><p>Silver doesn&#8217;t attempt to obfuscate the externalities of a world dominated by The River, but his bias is clear (this is his &#8220;tribe&#8221; and the book tends to celebrate it). Here he dips his toe into the AI risk debate (can we create superintelligent machines and what will they do with us) with a potential future called &#8220;Hyper-Commodified Casino Capitalism: </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The world becomes more casino-like: gamified, commodified, quantified, monitored and manipulated, and more elaborately tiered between the haves and have-nots. People with a canny perception of risk might thrive, but most people won&#8217;t. GDP growth might be high, but the gains will be unevenly distributed. Agency will be more unequal still; a few large companies, aided by their AIs, will have more power than democratically elected governments. Most people won&#8217;t have fulfilling, meaningful jobs, and many will hand their decision-making over to AIs that purport to have their best interest in mind but instead trap them in a loop of button-clicking compulsions. Are these AIs making people happy? Well, they&#8217;re making people content, for that&#8217;s what the algorithms will optimize for. Happiness is hard to measure. The soul of humanity dies a slow and unmourned death at some point in the mid-2050s.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Silver offers this as a possible dystopia, but frankly it seems like one of the best-case outcomes available to us considering the ascendance of Silicon Valley&#8217;s reactionaries. The world that lies waiting for us will not come to pass because of gambling, though gambling is actively ruining the one we currently live in.</p><div><hr></div><p>On CES</p><p>What does all of this have to do with CES? As long as I&#8217;ve been aware of CES, it has been related to me as a place where vendors use products that may or may not be real to peacock for investors ($$$), journalists (coverage), and other firms (deals). Sacrifice a virgin while dancing in the moonlight and you&#8217;re a superstitious nut. Sacrifice a pile of money while dancing in a windowless casino and you&#8217;re what Silicon Valley&#8217;s accelerationists call <a href="https://www.orphandriftarchive.com/articles/hyperstition-an-introduction/">&#8220;hyperstitious&#8221;</a>&#8212;able to &#8220;transmute lies into truths&#8221; by an obscure alchemical science known as wealth.</p><p>And so: entrepreneurs and investors enter into a dance where half-baked ideas or narrow use cases are given new life (scale) with a sufficient infusion of capital; journalists are lied to, seduced, distracted, or otherwise deputized in an extravagant masturbatory ritual performed with ironic self-awareness. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that while A is obviously never happening, B would be a genuine improvement?&#8221; I'm assured by financiers and writers who&#8217;ve come to the conference every year seriously wondering where their promised robot servants and sentient assistants are! </p><p>What was actually being offered at CES? This year, it was what Jared Newman called <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91259002/ces-was-a-giant-exercise-in-ai-gaslighting">&#8220;AI gaslighting&#8221;</a> as firms previewed plans to trick consumers into thinking long-offered features were new innovations made possible by &#8220;AI.&#8221; I saw a humanoid robots disclose &#8220;I am a text-based generative AI chatbot&#8221; before posing with audience members and answering questions as part of a transparent gimmick, crypto bros spin sleek trading platforms as financial AI agents, and salespeople use &#8220;AI&#8221; to refer to ecosystems of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/amazon-tracking-devices-surveillance-state/671772/">luxury surveillance devices</a>. Newman saw TV makers rebrand extant personalized recommendation and actor recognition systems as cutting-edge &#8220;AI&#8221;, PCs that let you optimize graphics settings with chatbots instead of singular buttons, and hardware (like smart glasses) that simply grafted large language models onto their products. Newman offers a somewhat upbeat explanation for this:</p><blockquote><p>Hardware makers want to demonstrate that they&#8217;re part of the AI revolution, but they don&#8217;t make the AI themselves and are bound by the limits of what large language models can do (which is still far from what <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91250279/ai-vaporware-7-products-that-didnt-materialize-in-2024">we&#8217;ve been promised they can do</a>). Outside of a few stray announcements, such as <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91256061/nvidia-stock-price-ai-products-ces-2025">Nvidia&#8217;s $3,000 desktop AI computer for programmers</a>, much of what happened at CES will have little direct bearing on where AI goes from here.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>Device makers, in other words, are trying to take credit for the wrong thing. I left CES feeling upbeat about the state of consumer electronics, but with a strange feeling that I had to ignore a vast amount of its messaging to get there.</p></blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think we can easily ignore the &#8220;vast amount&#8221; of gaslighting though there is something to Newman&#8217;s point about this being a &#8220;hardware&#8221; show amidst a &#8220;software&#8221; frenzy. Still, CES <a href="https://www.ces.tech/">claims</a> it there were an estimated 141,000 attendees, 4500 exhibitors, and 6000 "global media, content creators, and industry analysts.&#8221; We should be concerned if even a small fraction of this exhibition was vaporware&#8212;which it tends to be&#8212;and even more so if a significant portion of it is overtaken with snake oil salesmen insisting their products are now AI-powered&#8212;which it seemed to be.</p><p>I, and many others, have written extensively about the danger that our delusions about &#8220;AI&#8221; pose. It threatens to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/30/opinion/artificial-intelligence-danger.html">narrow our institutional imagination to the dreams of monopolistic firms</a> and flood the zone with <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/188313/artifical-intelligence-scams-propaganda-deceit">propaganda to reinforce these nightmarish visions</a>, rehabilitate <a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/13636">reactionary ideologies</a> that pine for the ancien r&#233;gime, and serves to enrich some of the least among us: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cfbfa1e8-d8f8-42b9-b74c-dae6cc6185a0">white South Africans who don&#8217;t seem to have gotten over the end of apartheid</a>. The concern about the <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/subprimeai/">Subprime AI crisis</a>, as Ed Zitron puts it, is that it will not only misallocate resources in a bubble that&#8217;ll burst and leave behind immiserated masses, dessicated public institutions, and an increasingly withered capacity for political action not aligned with Wall Street/Silicon Valley&#8217;s interests <strong>BUT</strong> that it&#8217;ll empower masters of the universe like Peter Thiel who seem interested in building the worst possible future for all but themselves.</p><p>Take <a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/reading-thiels-op-ed">John Ganz&#8217;s read</a> of a recent <em>Financial Times</em> op-ed by Thiel:</p><blockquote><p>Does Thiel believe, along with Girard, that the scapegoat mechanism no longer works, or just that we need new myths and scapegoats? Is he really a Christian or a pagan worshipping at the altar of technological Moloch? When the Silicon Valley occultists commune with the spirits are they talking to God or the Devil? It seems like as the alternative to violence spinning out of control, he wants to focus it on a few enemies, he wants the new regime to produce scapegoats. I think he doesn&#8217;t want it to look <em>too </em>savage and primitive. It has to have some semblance of order, otherwise, it will be too clear what&#8217;s going on&#8212;like the text, it needs to be a little esoteric. It has to have the appurtenances of justice and truth and be given a Christian covering, the possibility of forgiveness and mercy.</p><p>If you are creeped out by now that&#8217;s the point: this is all meant to be a little scary. He likes the whiff of incense and the air of hocus pocus. The founder of Palantir wants to imagine himself as a sorcerer. It is meant to sound impressive and, yes, stupefying. But he is not just mystifying but also himself mystified: fetishizing the world of commodities and their production as a religion. Being in the position to forgive is being in a position of power. And perhaps the ultimate one. Another question we might put to all these characters: Who do you think you are? God?</p></blockquote><p>An honest look at Palo Alto&#8217;s past (<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/san-francisco-silicon-valley-eugenics/">eugenics, environmental ruin, and surveillance</a>) and present (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/18/tech-bros-trump-inauguration-silicon-valley-nation-state">&#8220;less a fascism of blood and soil than a nihilistic capitalism of the bottom line&#8221;</a> as Quinn Slobodian puts it) suggests the world we&#8217;re racing towards will be dominated by bantustans, though I&#8217;m sure the Riverians won&#8217;t have much qualms about putting casinos inside of them. The sooner we free ourselves of delusions about Silicon Valley&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2024/09/19/venture-backed-trumpism-ben-tarnoff/">supposed right-wing turn</a>, the sooner we can <a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/can-ai-break-out-of-panglossian-neoliberalism/">articulate the futures we do or don&#8217;t want</a> (and the technologies involved in both) and speak a bit more bravely about the gap between the stakes and our willingness to act. Quickly approaching is the day when we will see the embrace of a genocidal telos (&#8220;<a href="https://jacobin.com/2011/12/four-futures/">exterminism</a>&#8221;) that&#8217;ll seek to sacrifice the environment, genetically and socially engineer humanity, and liquidate the uncooperative elements. All of the ingredients are already there. Now we wait for the Great Work that will bring together the brigands laying waste to our world for one last orgy of violence. Will it be those that seek to purify capitalism of its democratic flaw and colored defects? Or those that promise us it will give birth to yet another stillborn god?</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">The Tech Bubble is a reader-supported publication.

As the firestorm jumped the Pacific Coast Highway into densely populated suburbs of Santa Monica, a city in West LA, entire neighborhoods were turned into ash. A video taken late Wednesday night in the front seat of a car <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thundxrcloud.bsky.social/post/3lfajdffuu22w">driving down the PCH</a> from Palisades to Malibu shows rows of buildings engulfed in flames as hurricane-force winds <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/latimesphotos.bsky.social/post/3lfai3zbwne2y">spread the embers further</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s like driving through hell,&#8221; remarks the cameraperson.</p><p>The hellish scene in LA is a tragedy, but importantly it is not an isolated or independent event. A problem only for the many people in the evacuation zones. We must see this most recent crisis as one more node added to a global network of ongoing crises, each one resulting in different forms of mutually reinforced devastation, but all of them interconnected, with their consequences touching everybody, everywhere. We all live inside the firestorm now.</p><p>We have to see how the crisis and its impacts in LA are directly linked to, among other things, hurricanes in Florida, floods in Queensland, turbulence in the insurance industry, instability of mortgage markets, growing insecurity in society, and policies that have hollowed out government services and abandoned entire communities.</p><p>Consider how the firestorm is emblematic of systemic crises: ecological, financial, social, political.</p><p>Climate change is not merely a danger reserved for other people who are removed from us in space and time. We are seeing its immediate, material impacts right now. A warming world has created <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91256483/the-horrifying-l-a-wildfires-are-being-fueled-by-the-worst-conditions-january-has-ever-seen">conditions that are ripe for disaster</a>. Seasonal winds and wildfires are nothing new for California but their frequency and severity has intensified in recent decades.</p><p>Research supported by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that anthropogenic climate change has been <a href="https://www.drought.gov/news/study-shows-climate-change-main-driver-increasing-fire-weather-western-us">the &#8220;main driver</a> of this increase in fire weather in the western United States.&#8221; Warmer air holds more moisture leading to more rain which nurtures the growth of plant life. But when that rain is then followed by prolonged droughts and arid winds all that vegetation dehydrates, turning into kindling ready to burst into flames and embers. The increased fuel combined with fierce winds act as an accelerant for firestorms.</p><p>While we call them natural disasters, there is nothing natural about their level of destruction. Despite the known risks of building houses in places like Malibu or Miami, real estate capital continues pouring into high-risk areas without comparable investment into risk mitigation strategies to make buildings and communities more resilient to fires and floods. At the same time, austerity measures in the name of government efficiency have gutted essential services. In a case of terrible timing, last month LA Mayor Karen Bass <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/los-angeles-firefighters-begged-the">cut the LA Fire Department&#8217;s budget</a>, despite warnings that it would hamstring their ability to respond to large-scale emergencies.</p><p>All these social and political factors mean that when catastrophe inevitably hits, the personal and financial losses are far more significant. The most recent <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/accuweather-estimates-more-than-250-billion-in-damages-and-economic-loss-from-la-wildfires/1733821">estimates from AccuWeather</a> place the total damage and economic loss of the LA wildfires at $250 billion&#8212;and potentially the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fac1415c-b88c-41c2-8932-23c4e4b37a11">costliest disaster in US history</a>.</p><p>This financial disaster is caused and compounded by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-home-insurance-real-estate-crisis/">upheaval in insurance markets</a> and rampant <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-08-02/a-1-trillion-time-bomb-is-ticking-in-the-housing-market?sref=ZtdQlmKR">under-insurance for climate risks</a>. In response to large-scale wreckage caused by catastrophes like fire, flood, and hurricanes, property insurers are raising premiums to record highs and rejecting policies for markets deemed exclusion zones. <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/190048/california-insurance-los-angeles-fires">Despite popular narratives</a> framing insurers as victims on the brink of collapse, insurers benefit from &#8220;<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0308518X15594800">hard markets</a>&#8221; that allow them to <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/brentwood-encino-state-farm-nonrenewals-insurance-20028863.php">dump high-risk, low-profit policies</a> and <a href="https://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2024/release062-2024.cfm">agitate for regulatory change</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, communities who rarely had to think about their risk profiles&#8212;and largely do not understand their actual risks or coverage for catastrophes&#8212;are now confronted with the grim reality of being uninsurable. Even if they were fortunate to not lose everything this time, next time they may not be so lucky. And <a href="https://www.levernews.com/we-will-all-be-paying-for-l-a-s-wildfires/">the safety net</a> they once relied upon will be even more threadbare and full of holes.</p><p>With every new disaster that strikes, insurance policies become less available, less affordable, and less adequate for the growing numbers of people who need more protection in the face of more risks. &#8220;There may be more than $1 trillion in hidden home-value losses from floods and fires alone, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-01-08/california-wildfires-expose-a-458-billion-hole-in-home-insurance?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNjM2MjcwMSwiZXhwIjoxNzM2OTY3NTAxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUFM3REtEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIxMkE1QzVFRUNERDg0NUJEQjVFOTM1MUE0Mzk4QTAxNCJ9.c5hUTrnKMU6ZqfNYi2GdKxQoMdBGSf53k2SR_xPscHQ">writes</a> Bloomberg columnist Mark Gongloff, &#8220;posing the threat of a mini financial crisis.&#8221;</p><p>Indeed, a report last month by the US Senate Budget Committee warns of a &#8220;climate change-driven insurance crisis&#8221; based on new data about increased insurance non-renewals that shows &#8220;a crash in property values may be looming.&#8221; We can see further omens of a crash in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-home-loan-mortgage-insurance-climate-risks/">mortgage markets</a> as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fill their portfolios with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/business/economy/mortgages-climate-risk-fannie-freddie.html">perilous levels of climate risk</a> from fires and floods, while government regulators disregard the threats of unsustainable risk-taking.</p><p>There are similar shocks occurring in markets in the aptly named FIRE sector&#8212;finance, insurance, and real estate&#8212;around the world. For example, a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-10/insurance-costs-are-driving-thousands-to-breach-their-mortgages/104703586">new report</a> by the Australian Actuaries Institute shows that due to surging insurance costs nearly 200,000 households across Australia have either breached their mortgage contracts, or are at extreme risk of doing so, because they cannot afford to maintain insurance policies.</p><p>The systemic crises threatening the stability of these crucial markets&#8212;which are the foundation for so much wealth and security in modern society&#8212;continue to multiply and interface. It&#8217;s hard not to hear the distinct echo of the 2008 financial crash. The causes are different but the dynamics rhyme.</p><p>Our exploration of interconnected crises could keep expanding outward. A core feature of these many crises is that they don&#8217;t have the kinds of clear boundaries and direct causes that are conducive to simple framings of a problem and its solution. Our social world is much more complex.</p><p>Any effective strategy for mitigating the risks of such catastrophes&#8212;and responding to their aftermath&#8212;requires seriously confronting this network of crises. Or, what many now recognize as the age of polycrisis: a system in which seemingly &#8220;disparate shocks interact so that the whole is worse than the sum of the parts,&#8221; <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/498398e7-11b1-494b-9cd3-6d669dc3de33">writes Adam Tooze</a>.</p><p>The problem with polycrisis is that it defies any single fix&#8212;as if kicking sand on the smoldering coals in front of you will stop the inferno once and for all. But so far this has largely been our collective reaction to each individual crisis as they pop off, all while largely ignoring their networked nature and the systemic solutions they demand.</p><p>Unless we can read the signs and contain the spread of polycrisis, the LA firestorm will be yet another harbinger of more crises to come&#8212;until we are flanked on all sides by disasters with no clear escape route.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">The Tech Bubble is a 100% reader-supported publication.

				<![CDATA[<p>Welcome, valued Consumer, to the Tech Bubble Dispatch #3! This week&#8217;s recommendations: we've got some stuff on the UnitedHealthcare shooter, insurance tech, China, artificial intelligence, plus some book and music recommendations. This is a long ass roundup, as always there&#8217;s table of contents for you to quickly navigate if you just want a particular section or two.</p><p>Some housekeeping: Casey Newton <a href="https://www.platformer.news/ai-fake-and-sucks-revisited/">wrote</a> a (paywalled) response to <a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/the-phony-comforts-of-useful-idiots">my essay</a> (and <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/hard-forked-casey-newtons-distorted">Gary Marcus&#8217;s</a>) and it is surprisingly underwhelming! The limited engagement with our criticisms comes in the form of, well, ignoring our criticisms, doubling down on his framing, and pretending I am a Marxist labor organizer rambling about morality (though, to be fair, my essay is riddled with insults aimed at him &amp; his argument). I expected more <strong>despite</strong> his <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/03/kara-swisher-podcasts">proximity</a> to the <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-miseducation-of-kara-swisher-ongweso">Kara Swisher School of Journalism</a>, but alas. Fellow tech critic Paris Marx, who shares my general contempt for tech journalism, just published a <a href="https://disconnect.blog/dismissing-critics-has-real-and-dangerous-consequences/">wonderful contribution</a> to this entire debate&#8212;be sure to read it! AND Gary Marcus <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/hard-forked-casey-newtons-distorted">circled back to stomp out Casey Newton one more time</a>. </p><p>Inspiring people to crash out feels about as good as doing it yourself!</p><p>If you like the recommendations below and want more since they'll be paywalled eventually, then please <a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe">subscribe to the newsletter</a> for $7 a month (the price of a tallboy and some snacks) or $70 a year (the price of my undying love).

I am still forming my thoughts on this, largely because I&#8217;m more interested in why it&#8217;s taken so long for someone to (successfully) target such a prominent target <strong>and</strong> if we&#8217;d see anything like this in other areas (e.g. pharma, fossil fuels, Big Agriculture, Big Tech). That being said, I&#8217;ve read a lot of interesting essays, takes, notes, and analyses based on this that I wanted to share with you guys and hope you find insightful.</p><p>First off, some pieces from <strong>before </strong>we knew the shooter&#8217;s identity!</p><p>I think Taylor Lorenz&#8217;s <a href="https://www.usermag.co/p/yes-we-want-insurance-executives">&#8220;We &#8216;we&#8217; want insurance executives dead&#8221;</a> was the best essay clearly articulating why people were celebrating the United Healthcare CEO&#8217;s assassination and why various talking heads were incapable of understanding this rage:</p><blockquote><p>As fellow journalist <a href="https://open.substack.com/users/1980988-ken-klippenstein?utm_source=mentions">Ken Klippenstein</a> posted, "No shit murder is bad. The [commentary and jokes] about the United CEO aren&#8217;t really about him; they&#8217;re about the rapacious healthcare system he personified and which Americans feel deep pain and humiliation about."</p><p>This is what the media fails to understand. They don't see insurance CEOs who sanction the deaths of thousands of innocent people a year by denying them coverage, often coverage doctors deem medically necessary, as violent.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>Instead of centering the stories of those harmed by UnitedHealth and the very real outrage that most Americans feel about the way the healthcare system is run today, the media is publishing a tidal wave of breathless articles about the loss of "civility" and "respect" online.</p></blockquote><p>An hour before the gunman was captured and identified, Camille Sojit Pejcha <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-152847956?source=queue">published</a> an essay connecting the burgeoning fandom building around Luigi to a desperate plea from the public. It made me think of one of my favorite scenes in <em>First Reformed</em>, where Reverend Ernst Toller is spiraling about the church&#8217;s silence on climate change and bursts out &#8220;Well somebody has to do <em><strong>something</strong></em>! It's the Earth that hangs in the balance.&#8221; Camille&#8217;s piece:</p><blockquote><p>I&#8217;m inclined to believe that the public sentiment surrounding the gunman is evidence not just of our desire for him, but our desire for a figurehead: a modern-day folk hero who expresses our collective frustration with a broken, sometimes corrupt American healthcare system. We&#8217;re fed up, disenfranchised, and sick of the status quo. And if the face of our populist rage over a corrupt industry just so happens to have a stellar jawline&#8212;well, who&#8217;s going to complain about that?</p></blockquote><p>Since Luigi was identified as the alleged shooter, the internet has been trawling his deep digital footprint for clues about his political valence, who to blame, who to cheer, and What It All Means. Here are some good <strong>post-reveal</strong> pieces!</p><p>My old Motherboard boss Jason Koebler <a href="https://www.404media.co/luigi-mangione-played-among-us-breathes-air/">wrote a great meta-story</a> on the "ritualized rifling through old internet accounts" that follows in the wake of news events like this one (Also please subscribe to 404 Media, which is far and away <strong>the best tech journalism outlet on the internet</strong>&#8212;it&#8217;s also worker owned!)</p><blockquote><p>I do not plan on ever doing a murder or anything that ever puts me into the news in the same way Mangione is now. But whenever something like this happens I find myself thinking about my own digital footprint, which is extremely vast and in many cases extremely outdated. I do not think that my high school Live Journal or Facebook posts that I don&#8217;t even remember says anything about who I am as a person now or why I do literally anything that I do. But if you are good enough at Googling me you can probably find accounts I have and accounts I didn&#8217;t even know that I had and use it to build some sort of narrative about my life. I have met thousands of people in my life and plausibly any journalist could get in touch with one of them within a few moments and maybe they would say something about me&#8212;does that reflect who I am or why I do anything that I do? Probably not!</p></blockquote><p>That being said, Max Read <a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/what-type-of-guy-is-the-alleged-uhc">did a great job looking at Luigi Mangione&#8217;s recent digital footprint</a> to get a sense of what our assassin was concretely interested in (his media consumption, his politics, etc.) in hopes of offering a roadmap that avoids the mistakes and temptations laid out by Jason&#8217;s essay.</p><blockquote><p>This type of guy--<a href="https://x.com/tolstoybb/status/1866189245792366883">the account Tolstoybb calls Mangione a</a> &#8220;birthrates center-right pop science centrist type&#8221;--might be sort of boring to talk to at a party. But the thing is, he could go to a party or hold down a job and talk about his beliefs without raising any red flags. In other words, he doesn&#8217;t sound particularly <em>strange</em>, in the sense of foreign to experience. Nor does he come across as a &#8220;extreme&#8221;: Mangione&#8217;s beliefs, such as we can interpret them through his social media accounts, are pretty normal for a man of his age and background; they&#8217;re not those of the median American voter, precisely, but I suspect they&#8217;re pretty close to the views of the median 20-something white male tech worker. (Even <a href="https://x.com/jennygzhang/status/1866189754301370628">his generous review of Ted Kazcynski&#8217;s manifesto</a> is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/unabomber-netflix-tv-series-ted-kaczynski/">not particularly outr&#233; for people from his general cohort</a>.) It&#8217;s the kind of worldview a curious but indiscriminate person might assemble out of the podcasts they listen to on their commute or during their workout in a particularly alienating period of life (i.e., your 20s).</p></blockquote><p>In <a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/the-tinkerer">&#8220;The Tinkerer&#8221;</a> John Ganz connects Mangione and his politics to a sacred American tradition: &#8220;that of the vigilante gunman&#8221; but adds that there is something else here:</p><blockquote><p>What we are facing in the United States today is an overlapping crisis of institutions: social problems that stubbornly resist normal political solutions and a sense that the old system of meritocratic recognition is either broken or, at least, deeply unsatisfying for the young. Like many well-off young people, he comes from a bourgeois family that owns property but decided instead of business to pursue a high-status profession that&#8217;s supposed to be about rationally improving the world, only to find that idealistic path blocked in various frustrating ways. Even for the &#8220;normal&#8221; and relatively successful something feels terribly broken and alienating. When you combine these things you will get tragic and desperate attempts at heroism. The crowd already loves it.</p></blockquote><p>In <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-rage-transcends">his newsletter</a>, Brian Merchant builds on this to survey a host of concerning developments as the wealthy and elite build higher and higher walls for their fortresses, affix turrets along the perimeter, and commit themselves to even more destructive extraction/exploitation outside those limits.</p><blockquote><p>What&#8217;s made all the more clear by the outpouring of relative solidarity for a right-leaning tech guy who gunned down an executive in broad daylight is that we are sitting on not just one but an expansive and overlapping constellation of powder kegs right now. The Trump administration has only promised to further calcify the state&#8217;s anti-democratic tendencies, restrict its ability to respond to the populace in ways that might ameliorate suffering, and embark on brand new authoritarian projects like orchestrating mass deportation, firing competent bureaucrats to replace them with loyalists, and gutting the Department of Education; significant rage generators all.</p><p>There is murderous rage, there is vandalistic rage, there is wanton rage, and, of course, there is the sort that arose after the killing of George Floyd; righteous rage, with millions pouring into the streets to pointedly confront legacies of injustice. But too little changed, again. The rich merely have better and more weaponized fortresses, and more riches, and the nonrich have more of their rage.</p></blockquote><p>And our last entry comes from Sam Adler-Bell in <em><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/americans-welcome-unitedhealthcare-shooting-brian-thompson.html">New York Mag</a></em>:</p><blockquote><p>The shooter claimed this prerogative for himself without a corporate bureaucracy, an algorithm, or a system of laws to authorize the privilege. It is a terrible thing to destroy a human life for the sake of propaganda, and a terrible thing to do so for the sake of profit. (There is hubris in both.) We will not be able to disrupt our metabolism for social suffering by indulging our appetite for political violence; we can&#8217;t kill our way out of a society premised on human disposability. But it must be said that violence finds more purchase, seduces more persuasively, in the absence of other obvious and meaningful pathways for registering discontent. Americans are dying, going bankrupt, and wallowing in despair under a health-care system that prioritizes the profits of some over the basic needs of others: Where should they turn? Who is listening?</p></blockquote><h1>Insurance Tech</h1><p>Over the years, my podcast co-host (Jathan Sadowski) and his studies of the insurance industry&#8217;s integration of various digital technologies have revealed to me a land of eldritch horrors. In the coming weeks we will see people attempt to quibble about how much Americans actually spend on healthcare and who is to actually blame for high prices and what fixes would actually solve it. One thing almost none of these debates will touch on is how the integration of surveillance tech degrades care or humiliates patients, or the threat is poses under the guise of Transforming Healthcare.</p><p>In this section: I&#8217;ll share a series of papers that illuminate how much surveillance is being integrated into health/life insurance in the name of &#8220;behavioral control&#8221; to ostensibly ensure everyone is healthier and costs less to insure, but in reality to introduce a brutal form of profit maximization targeting vulnerable populations. </p><p>The first piece of Jathan&#8217;s I saw was a 2020 essay in <em>Real Life </em>(RIP, but please subscribe to founding editor Rob Horning&#8217;s excellent newsletter: <em><a href="https://robhorning.substack.com/">Internal Exile</a></em>) titled <a href="https://reallifemag.com/draining-the-risk-pool/">&#8220;Draining the Risk Pool.&#8221;</a> I&#8217;ll quote Jathan at length to pique your interest in the next few essays:</p><blockquote><p>With an expansive network of stuff recording how you behave across virtually every realm of daily life, your insurer aims to track compliance perfectly and handle claims automatically through agents powered by artificial intelligence. Enforcement, from their point of view, will be unbiased and certain; there can be no confusion or disagreement about who owes what to whom when they can just check the data. By this logic, fiduciary duty compels for-profit insurance companies to discipline policyholders and diminish the horizon of possibility based on what the stats have shown is the most profitable life to lead &#8212; and, by extension, kind of person to be. That&#8217;s if you&#8217;re lucky enough to be deemed worthy of insurance at all.</p><p>Insurance has always been a kind of mathematical morality. Embedded in the calculations, models, contracts, and other tools of the actuarial trade are judgments about who is responsible, what things are worth, how society should be organized. The promise of insurtech is that these judgments can be made objectively about and applied universally to every individual. Yet this individualized approach is a redefinition of what is &#8220;fair&#8221;: rather than spreading risks across a population to hedge against the vagaries of life, the data-driven system promotes the sense that no one should bear any expense or risk for the benefit of the collective. From this perspective, insurers are right, even obligated, to treat different people in different ways based on predictions of their future behaviors. Technology, in turn, should be focused on this discriminatory task rather than being directed toward extending better coverage to broader populations and reducing the collective insecurity that impedes a flourishing society.</p><p>The idiosyncratic view of fairness underlying this worldview readily justifies a range of perverse consequences. If there&#8217;s a great divide between the premiums people pay that happens to mirror other structural and systemic inequalities in society, then at least it was implemented &#8220;fairly.&#8221; If some people are saddled with restrictive policy conditions and others receive special treatment, then at least it&#8217;s in the name of &#8220;fairness.&#8221; If an underclass of the underinsured and uninsurable is created, then at least it&#8217;s the result of a more fair society.</p></blockquote><p>Later that year, <em>Big Data &amp; Society </em>titled <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/page/bds/collections/personalizationofinsurance">"The Personalization of Insurance"</a> that looked at how insurance practices where changing: what technologies, methods, markets, and firms were involved in the integration of data and surveillance. The whole issue is of interest but one place to start is an article by Alberto Cevolini and Elena Esposito titled "From pool to profile: Social consequences of algorithmic prediction in insurance&#8221; given how prominently <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/14/unitedhealth-algorithm-medicare-advantage-investigation/">algorithmic discrimination</a> figures into United Healthcare&#8217;s business model. The abstract:</p><blockquote><p>The use of algorithmic prediction in insurance is regarded as the beginning of a new era, because it promises to personalise insurance policies and premiums on the basis of individual behaviour and level of risk. The core idea is that the price of the policy would no longer refer to the calculated uncertainty of a pool of policyholders, with the consequence that everyone would have to pay only for her real exposure to risk. For insurance, however, uncertainty is not only a problem &#8211; shared uncertainty is a resource. The availability of individual risk information could undermine the principle of risk-pooling and risk-spreading on which insurance is based. The article examines this disruptive change first by exploring the possible consequences of the use of predictive algorithms to set insurance premiums. Will it endanger the principle of mutualisation of risks, producing new forms of discrimination and exclusion from coverage? In a second step, we analyse how the relationship between the insurer and the policyholder changes when the customer knows that the company has voluminous, and continuously updated, data about her real behaviour.</p></blockquote><p>Next are three papers from Jathan that&#8217;ve been very illuminating for me and are great places to start if you&#8217;re interested. First up is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03085147.2024.2328992">a case study</a> of UK-based behavioral insurance company Vitality and what goes into its efforts building an ecosystem of surveillance technology to modify individual behavior.</p><blockquote><p>Imagine your insurer were an &#8216;active life partner&#8217;, even a guardian of your future, which engaged with you on a regular basis, through a complex system of digital technology and behavioural science, to ensure you were leading the healthiest, longest, most valuable life possible. This is the foundation for a growing model of &#8216;behavioural insurance&#8217; that has become a major approach in the industry. By capturing constant streams of data about consumer behaviour, and creating incentive programmmes to modify how people behave, insurers hope to unlock a key source of value and risk management. We critically analyze this model through a detailed case study of a world leader in behavioural insurance: Discovery Limited and its Vitality ecosystem of data-driven, behaviour-based, interactive wellbeing programmes for life/health insurance. We detail the behavioural theory of risk and the moral economy of &#8216;shared value&#8217;, which underpins the model of insurance that Vitality champions and justifies its activist approach to social change.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/fire-watchers-the-centrality-of-surveillance-studies-for-finance-">second paper</a> is on the extent which with our FIRE sector (finance, insurance, and real estate) has embraced digital technologies. What sort of tech is being developed, towards what ends, and by what actors? What practices are they encouraging or disrupting, what claims are they supporting in the tech sector, and what does all of this have to do with surveillance?</p><blockquote><p>The deepening integration of the technology sector with the FIRE sector (finance, insurance, real estate) is, arguably, one of the most consequential developments in contemporary political economy. With names like fintech, insurtech, and proptech, the influence of these industries can be found everywhere and only continues to grow. At their heart, the rise of FIRE-tech is about upgrading old and building new forms of surveillance and then applying them to increasingly more people, places, and processes. And yet, critical research on FIRE-tech from the field of surveillance studies has not kept pace with these developments. This special issue offers us a chance to look back on the contributions made by the field and look ahead at the challenges it now faces. As we think about the issues and agendas that should guide our research moving forward, there is value in bringing surveillance studies and FIRE-tech into closer alignment. Doing so provides an opportunity to increase the analytical power and ongoing relevance of the field by critically confronting the development, purpose, and impact of FIRE-tech. In short, we should frame FIRE as surveillance and we should see surveillance via FIRE.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03063127231186437">third paper</a> is about trying to highlight the importance of insurance for modern civilization, and by extension how consequential the emergence of certain technologies could prove to be in life/health insurance.</p><blockquote><p>Calling attention to the growing intersection between the insurance and technology sectors&#8212;or &#8216;insurtech&#8217;&#8212;this article is intended as a bat signal for the interdisciplinary fields that have spent recent decades studying the explosion of digitization, datafication, smartification, automation, and so on. Many of the dynamics that attract people to researching technology are exemplified, often in exaggerated ways, by emerging applications in insurance, an industry that has broad material effects. Based on in-depth mixed-methods research into insurance technology, I have identified a set of interlocking logics that underly this regime of actuarial governance in society: ubiquitous intermediation, continuous interaction, total integration, hyper-personalization, actuarial discrimination, and dynamic reaction. Together these logics describe how enduring ambitions and existing capabilities are motivating the future of how insurers engage with customers, data, time, and value. This article surveys each logic, laying out a techno-political framework for how to orient critical analysis of developments in insurtech and where to direct future research on this growing industry. Ultimately, my goal is to advance our understanding how insurance&#8212;a powerful institution that is fundamental to the operations of modern society&#8212;continues to change, and what dynamics and imperatives, whose desires and interests are steering that change. The stuff of insurance is far too important to be left to the insurance industry.</p></blockquote><p>And lastly, I want to point you towards <a href="https://lpeproject.org/blog/private-insurance-public-power-a-symposium/">a symposium</a> by the Law and Political Economy Project focused squarely on insurance:</p><blockquote><p>From the health care we receive to the public services our cities provide, private insurers play a considerable yet often overlooked role in our political economy. And insurance markets, of course, do not arise naturally or spontaneously, but are instead the product specific social and legal conditions. The law enables insurers to take on this outsized role by carving out antitrust exceptions for the insurance industry, by allowing insurance industry lobbyists to influence political decisionmaking, and by making possible the financial instruments that profit from risky development.</p></blockquote><h1>China</h1><p>The US-China Cold War has been raging for years now, with the tit-for-tat game poised to ratchet up with Trump&#8217;s return to the White House. On December 5th, <em>The Financial Times</em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/72f9418e-e611-4bc5-a11b-705de5a81637">reported</a> on China's attempts to respond to the latest wave of US export controls by shifting to local chips and a ban on shipping key minerals and metals to the United States. </p><blockquote><p>Analysts at Bernstein estimate Chinese groups have the power to influence sourcing decisions for the roughly 40 per cent of the global smartphone market they control and the 23 per cent of the computer market supplied by companies that include the world&#8217;s largest PC maker Lenovo.</p><p>Customers in China, for example, contributed 27 per cent of sales last year for Intel, America&#8217;s stumbling traditional chip champion. Artificial intelligence chip giant Nvidia drew 17 per cent of sales from the country. Arizona-based Onsemi estimates its chips are in half of China&#8217;s electric vehicles. Mobile processor maker Qualcomm derived about half of its $39bn in annual revenue from China.</p></blockquote><p>On December 9th, <em>The Financial Times</em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1b1ed4b3-4ecf-47a1-8a25-fee8391b88b6">reported</a> China was launching an antitrust probe into Nvidia. Life comes at you fast. </p><blockquote><p>Over recent years, Nvidia has become a global market leader in AI chips, with its graphics processing units becoming crucial in developing leading AI models. But US export controls have forced Nvidia to sell watered-down versions of its must-have GPUs in China and given rise to a large black market of smugglers who illegally bring its more advanced processors into China.</p><p>&#8220;This probe appears to be a political action rather than a legal one,&#8221; said a Chinese antitrust expert, who asked not to be named, adding: &#8220;Never before has state media taken the lead in announcing an investigation.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>And on December 12, <em>The New York Times </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/us/politics/tech-sales-china-huawei.html">reported</a> on the fight breaking out between government officials and tech firms over restricted sales to China. </p><blockquote><p>Over the past year, an intense struggle has played out in Washington between companies that sell machinery to make semiconductors and Biden officials who are bent on slowing China&#8217;s technological progress. Officials argue that China&#8217;s ability to make chips that create artificial intelligence, guide autonomous drones and launch cyberattacks is a national security threat, and they have clamped down on U.S. technology exports, including in new rules last week.</p><p>But many in the semiconductor industry have fought to limit the rules and preserve a critical source of revenue, more than a dozen current and former U.S. officials said. Most requested anonymity to discuss sensitive internal government interactions or exchanges with the industry.</p><p>The U.S. chip equipment companies argue that they do not oppose stronger rules as long as they also apply to international competitors. Their chief complaint is that the U.S. industry is the only one facing restrictions, allowing companies in Japan and the Netherlands to step in to supply China with technology. That damages U.S. companies while also failing to restrain Beijing, they argue.</p></blockquote><p>Early last month, <em>The Economist</em> wrote up <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/11/12/mega-polluter-china-believes-it-is-a-climate-saviour">a great overview</a> of the absolute juggernaut China has become in the global race to build up green energy before we destroy our ecological niche</p><blockquote><p>Chinese money props up every stage of the clean-energy supply chain. Between 2018 and 2023 global investment in the refineries and factories that turn raw materials into wind turbines, electric vehicles (EVs) and other green technologies came to $378bn, according to BloombergNEF, a research firm. Nearly 90% of that came from China (see chart 1).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSXY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed90a2f6-91be-43b6-aab9-e5e42dae2821_360x370.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSXY!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed90a2f6-91be-43b6-aab9-e5e42dae2821_360x370.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSXY!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed90a2f6-91be-43b6-aab9-e5e42dae2821_360x370.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSXY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed90a2f6-91be-43b6-aab9-e5e42dae2821_360x370.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSXY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed90a2f6-91be-43b6-aab9-e5e42dae2821_360x370.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSXY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed90a2f6-91be-43b6-aab9-e5e42dae2821_360x370.png" width="360" height="370" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ed90a2f6-91be-43b6-aab9-e5e42dae2821_360x370.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:370,&quot;width&quot;:360,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSXY!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed90a2f6-91be-43b6-aab9-e5e42dae2821_360x370.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSXY!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed90a2f6-91be-43b6-aab9-e5e42dae2821_360x370.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSXY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed90a2f6-91be-43b6-aab9-e5e42dae2821_360x370.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YSXY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed90a2f6-91be-43b6-aab9-e5e42dae2821_360x370.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg

Its companies manufacture enough lithium-ion batteries (which are used to power EVs) to satisfy the whole of global demand. Eight in ten of the world&#8217;s solar panels are made in China, according to the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental body. By building whopping economies of scale and competing with each other fiercely, Chinese companies have slashed costs.</p><p>China is not only supplying these technologies, it is driving demand for them. More than half of its electricity is still generated by coal. But last year Chinese firms plugged some 300 gigawatts of wind- and solar-power capacity into the grid, nearly two-thirds of the amount installed globally. (For comparison, Britain&#8217;s total power capacity is 100 gigawatts.) In June the world&#8217;s biggest solar farm came online in western China. It covers an area twice the size of Manhattan. China is also building more nuclear-power plants than any other country. Last year global spending on the deployment of clean-energy technologies came to $1.8trn, according to BloombergNEF, of which 38% occurred in China (see chart 2).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7RT9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfccdd06-a058-4d4e-aff6-0c53cb5ce794_360x370.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7RT9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfccdd06-a058-4d4e-aff6-0c53cb5ce794_360x370.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7RT9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfccdd06-a058-4d4e-aff6-0c53cb5ce794_360x370.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7RT9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfccdd06-a058-4d4e-aff6-0c53cb5ce794_360x370.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7RT9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfccdd06-a058-4d4e-aff6-0c53cb5ce794_360x370.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7RT9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfccdd06-a058-4d4e-aff6-0c53cb5ce794_360x370.png" width="360" height="370" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cfccdd06-a058-4d4e-aff6-0c53cb5ce794_360x370.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:370,&quot;width&quot;:360,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7RT9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfccdd06-a058-4d4e-aff6-0c53cb5ce794_360x370.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7RT9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfccdd06-a058-4d4e-aff6-0c53cb5ce794_360x370.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7RT9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfccdd06-a058-4d4e-aff6-0c53cb5ce794_360x370.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7RT9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfccdd06-a058-4d4e-aff6-0c53cb5ce794_360x370.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg

In Europe, outright climate scepticism is rare and the EU has built an impressive suite of subsidies and carbon pricing. The end of coal-fired power generation in the UK this year was historic. But in Europe too the cost of living crisis is swinging the political mood against tough climate action. The looming crisis in the European car industry, brought on by Chinese success in EVs, exposes the hypocrisy of a continent that promised a Green Deal while clinging to diesel.</p><p>To varying degrees, both Europe and the US have failed to grasp the decarbonisation challenge identified by their own scientists decades ago. Insofar as there is to be a global climate leader it can now only be China, which is responsible for more than 30 per cent of global emissions and has mastered the green energy supply chain. Given mounting tension with the US, Beijing has every incentive to minimise oil imports. The key question is whether the Chinese Communist party can muster the political will to override its fossil fuel interests. If it can, it will not single-handedly solve the climate crisis but it will assert a claim to leadership that the west will find hard to answer.</p></blockquote><h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1><p>I&#8217;m working on the third part of my series of essays on AI (read parts 1 and 2), so I&#8217;ll share some of the stuff that&#8217;s informing the next entry!</p><p>First off is Brian Merchant's <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/general/ai-generated-business">report</a> for the AI Now Institute that tracks the emergence of "AGI" as a lodestar for generative AI firms and their attempts to cobble together business models.</p><blockquote><p>Taken together, we see a portrait of a company that wrapped itself in an altruistic narrative mythology to attract researchers, investment, and press. It stumbled into a hit app that opened a pathway to a new product category in commercial generative AI (something Silicon Valley had been pursuing unsuccessfully for years), ignited a gold rush, drew competitors, and wielded its unique legacy and relationship to AGI to differentiate itself. However, given that generative AI technology is so expensive to develop and run, a unique imperative to generate revenue&#8212;lots of revenue&#8212;in order to capitalize on its popularity, cultural cachet, and market opportunity has become the company&#8217;s dominant concern. (In the past, as mentioned earlier, OpenAI has stated that its move away from nonprofit status was necessitated by the need for more compute power if it were to make satisfactory progress in creating AGI. This can be seen instead as a move toward preparing for an era of commercial product releases, even if the company remained unprepared for the success of ChatGPT when it arrived.) This is how a company transforms from a nonprofit whose aim is to be &#8220;owned by all of humanity&#8221; and &#8220;free of the profit motive&#8221; to one whose board is purged of safety experts in favor of Larry Summers.</p></blockquote><p>In <em>Nature</em>, David Gray Widder, Meredith Whittaker &amp; Sarah Myers West <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08141-1">published</a> an essay about the illusory nature of "open" artificial intelligence&#8212;systems that are ostensibly transparent and allow for modification, fine-tuning, and competition.</p><blockquote><p>This paper examines &#8216;open&#8217; artificial intelligence (AI). Claims about &#8216;open&#8217; AI often lack precision, frequently eliding scrutiny of substantial industry concentration in large-scale AI development and deployment, and often incorrectly applying understandings of &#8216;open&#8217; imported from free and open-source software to AI systems. At present, powerful actors are seeking to shape policy using claims that &#8216;open&#8217; AI is either beneficial to innovation and democracy, on the one hand, or detrimental to safety, on the other. When policy is being shaped, definitions matter. To add clarity to this debate, we examine the basis for claims of openness in AI, and offer a material analysis of what AI is and what &#8216;openness&#8217; in AI can and cannot provide: examining models, data, labour, frameworks, and computational power. We highlight three main affordances of &#8216;open&#8217; AI, namely transparency, reusability, and extensibility, and we observe that maximally &#8216;open&#8217; AI allows some forms of oversight and experimentation on top of existing models. However, we find that openness alone does not perturb the concentration of power in AI. Just as many traditional open-source software projects were co-opted in various ways by large technology companies, we show how rhetoric around &#8216;open&#8217; AI is frequently wielded in ways that exacerbate rather than reduce concentration of power in the AI sector.</p></blockquote><p>Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17840">second paper</a> is from David Gray Widder as well as Sireesh Gururaja and Lucy Suchman looks at Pentagon funding for defense tech that integrates algorithmic systems:</p><blockquote><p>In the context of unprecedented U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budgets, this paper examines the recent history of DoD funding for academic research in algorithmically based warfighting. We draw from a corpus of DoD grant solicitations from 2007 to 2023, focusing on those addressed to researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Considering the implications of DoD funding for academic research, the paper proceeds through three analytic sections. In the first, we offer a critical examination of the distinction between basic and applied research, showing how funding calls framed as basic research nonetheless enlist researchers in a war fighting agenda. In the second, we offer a diachronic analysis of the corpus, showing how a &#8216;one small problem&#8217; caveat, in which affirmation of progress in military technologies is qualified by acknowledgement of outstanding problems, becomes justification for additional investments in research. We close with an analysis of DoD aspirations based on a subset of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant solicitations for the use of AI in battlefield applications. Taken together, we argue that grant solicitations work as a vehicle for the mutual enlistment of DoD funding agencies and the academic AI research community in setting research agendas. The trope of basic research in this context offers shelter from significant moral questions that military applications of on</p></blockquote><p>This <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14831">next paper</a> comes out of AI Now, authored by  Heidy Khlaaf, Sarah Myers West, and Meredith Whittaker. Here the focus is on commercial AI models deployed for the military but trained on personal data swept up by data brokers or particularly prone to high-cost errors that harm civilians (e.g. injury or death):</p><blockquote><p>Discussions regarding the dual use of foundation models and the risks they pose have overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of use cases and national security directives-in particular, how AI may enable the efficient construction of a class of systems referred to as CBRN: chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. The overwhelming focus on these hypothetical and narrow themes has occluded a much-needed conversation regarding present uses of AI for military systems, specifically ISTAR: intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance. These are the uses most grounded in actual deployments of AI that pose life-or-death stakes for civilians, where misuses and failures pose geopolitical consequences and military escalations. This is particularly underscored by novel proliferation risks specific to the widespread availability of commercial models and the lack of effective approaches that reliably prevent them from contributing to ISTAR capabilities.<br>In this paper, we outline the significant national security concerns emanating from current and envisioned uses of commercial foundation models outside of CBRN contexts, and critique the narrowing of the policy debate that has resulted from a CBRN focus (e.g. compute thresholds, model weight release). We demonstrate that the inability to prevent personally identifiable information from contributing to ISTAR capabilities within commercial foundation models may lead to the use and proliferation of military AI technologies by adversaries. We also show how the usage of foundation models within military settings inherently expands the attack vectors of military systems and the defense infrastructures they interface with. We conclude that in order to secure military systems and limit the proliferation of AI armaments, it may be necessary to insulate military AI systems and personal data from commercial foundation models.</p></blockquote><p>And <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14160">a final paper</a> from Ga&#235;l Varoquaux, Alexandra Sasha Luccioni, and Meredith Whittaker on how this race to build bigger AI models comes with staggeringly high costs whether it comes to climate, surveillance, or the domination of our politics and knowledge production by private interests:</p><blockquote><p>With the growing attention and investment in recent AI approaches such as large language models, the narrative that the larger the AI system the more valuable, powerful and interesting it is is increasingly seen as common sense. But what is this assumption based on, and how are we measuring value, power, and performance? And what are the collateral consequences of this race to ever-increasing scale? Here, we scrutinize the current scaling trends and trade-offs across multiple axes and refute two common assumptions underlying the 'bigger-is-better' AI paradigm: 1) that improved performance is a product of increased scale, and 2) that all interesting problems addressed by AI require large-scale models. Rather, we argue that this approach is not only fragile scientifically, but comes with undesirable consequences. First, it is not sustainable, as its compute demands increase faster than model performance, leading to unreasonable economic requirements and a disproportionate environmental footprint. Second, it implies focusing on certain problems at the expense of others, leaving aside important applications, e.g. health, education, or the climate. Finally, it exacerbates a concentration of power, which centralizes decision-making in the hands of a few actors while threatening to disempower others in the context of shaping both AI research and its applications throughout society.</p></blockquote><h1>Science Fiction</h1><p>If you&#8217;re reading my recommendation roundups, you know how much I love science fiction. Here are this week&#8217;s two book recommendations:</p><h2>Star of the Unborn by Franz Werfel</h2><p>I have spent the past ten years recommending Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon to anyone who will listen&#8212;in fact you should stop reading and find that book first if you haven't read it already (go in blind). But for those who are familiar with it and were wanting for something more (like a plot, though there is not much of one here either), then this is the book for you. A travelogue set 100,000 years into the future, like all my other recommendations you <strong>must</strong> go in blind.</p><h2>Lessons in Birdwatching by Honey Watson</h2><p>Here's to the crazy ones. The degenerates. The perverts. The sickos. The people who like to watch. The ones who see things differently. If you do not enjoy this book (and feel parts of yourself squirm in the process), then I am praying for the salvation of your eternal soul.</p><h1>Song of the Week</h1><p>Here are two songs I hope you enjoy!</p><h2>Willie Scott &amp; The Birmingham Spirituals &#8211; Keep Your Faith to the Sky</h2><div id="youtube2-dHH3zsk0mBQ" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;dHH3zsk0mBQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dHH3zsk0mBQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><h2>Eugene McDaniels - The Parasite (For Buffy) </h2><div id="youtube2-xFNzifsV9KM" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;xFNzifsV9KM&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xFNzifsV9KM?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>And that&#8217;s it for the roundup this week!

I want to go through its five parts then talk more generally about that mode of commentary:</p><p><strong>I. </strong></p><p>The core thrust of Newton&#8217;s piece is that the entire range of AI discourse boils down to two groups: critics external to firms and organizations directly working on or studying AI (they believe &#8220;AI is fake and sucks&#8221;) and internal critics who understand &#8220;AI is real and dangerous.&#8221; Newton aligns himself with the latter and suggests that the former camp are not only incapable of recognizing genuine innovations made in this field, but risk leaving us blind to threats enabled by those advances.</p><p>It&#8217;s not clear why anyone should entertain Newton&#8217;s false dichotomy, especially if they spend more than a second thinking about this.

Microsoft <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/09/microsoft-ai-oil-contracts/679804/">claims</a> it is fighting climate change by accelerating fossil fuel extraction with generative AI products that generate tens of billions of dollars for oil companies and the tech giant. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/technology/google-israel-contract-project-nimbus.html">Israeli apartheid</a> is powered by AI tech provided by Google, while Israel&#8217;s genocide of Palestinians is bolstered by <a href="https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/">automated systems</a> that function as a <a href="https://www.972mag.com/mass-assassination-factory-israel-calculated-bombing-gaza/">&#8220;mass assassination factory.&#8221;</a> The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03063127231186437">rise of the insurance tech industry</a> has seen the advent of AI tools that promise healthcare revolutions but are part of a longer line of profit-driven, hyper-personalized reforms that have been degrading conditions. It&#8217;s hard to imagine a world where one could, with a serious face, say all of this boils down to: &#8220;fake and sucks&#8221; vs &#8220;real and dangerous.&#8221; </p><p>Let&#8217;s hone in on a specific example to really drive it home.</p><p>Criticisms of AI systems integrated into Isareli apartheid and genocide point out how the automated systems generate kill lists, but also how they obscure accountability&#8212;they offer post hoc justification for war crimes and human rights violations that Israel was already eager to commit. The system is real and dangerous (integrated into an expansive man-machine decision-making system aimed at assassination), but also fake and sucks (purportedly built to help identify military targets, but quickly ran out and shifted to indiscriminately bombing everything).</p><p>At best, an attempt to flatten AI criticism in any of these areas to &#8220;fake and sucks&#8221; vs &#8220;real and dangerous&#8221; would be idiotic. At worst, it would deeply intellectually dishonest.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>So right off the bat, critically engaging with the core premise of Newton&#8217;s piece reveals how useless it is if we are interested in describing reality, but especially if we are interested in thinking coherently about AI skepticism. Nonetheless, let&#8217;s try to use it in good faith and see where it leads us. </p><p>Section II of Newton&#8217;s essay articulates why he believes AI is real &amp; dangerous by defining some key terms and offering some evidence to support his argument, all of which also shed some light on why he has settled on this criticism binary.</p><p>First, when Newton says &#8220;AI&#8221; he means &#8220;generative AI and the LLMs that power them &#8212; the technology that underpins ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and all the rest.&#8221; When Newton says &#8220;real&#8221; he means &#8220;a genuine innovation that will likely sustain a large and profitable industry.&#8221;</p><p>Newton points to the user base of generative chatbots (300 million weekly ChatGPT users), the money tech giants are spending on this technology (a planned quarter-trillion dollars), and ways it's being used today that "feel surprising and new." Let&#8217;s dive into each.</p><p>It's not clear why Newton believes a large userbase means it'll sustain a large and profitable industry. Even though OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT is one of the largest consumer products on the Internet, it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html">burning through billions</a> with no profit anytime soon. Ed Zitron&#8217;s dogged analysis of OpenAI's financials is worth considering: he argues that the company is not only <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/to-serve-altman/#:~:text=I%20ultimately%20believe,to%20develop%20them.">unprofitable and unsustainable and untenable</a> in its current form, but would also need to <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/">massively expand its revenue, massively cut costs that have only grown, pursue massive price hikes, realize a significant technological breakthrough in the form of an exponentially better model that costs less to train, and continue to sustain explosive growth that&#8217;s already stumbling.</a> None of this has anything to do with whether AI is &#8220;real&#8221; or &#8220;fake,&#8221; but concerns raised about generative AI that touch on burn rate, energy input, scaling models, training data seem to be summarily dismissed by Newton as whining about AI being &#8220;fake.&#8221;</p><p>Let&#8217;s close our eyes then, click our heels, and go to a land where a company&#8217;s finances don&#8217;t matter. Uber is an instructive example here. For years, reporters and commentators who did not bother to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3668606">closely examine Uber&#8217;s working conditions or financial health or lobbying efforts</a> simply assumed it would grow into profits like Amazon through <em>network effects</em>. As economist Hubert Horan documented in his <a href="https://horanaviation.com/publications-uber">33-part series</a> on Uber&#8217;s business model, ride-hail&#8217;s unit economics are fundamentally hostile to sustainable profits. To square this circle, Uber took tens of billions of dollars it received from venture capitalists and <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/05/ubers-path-of-destruction/">spent those subsidies on</a>: exploiting legal loopholes to externalize and minimize labor costs, write and pass laws to expand said loopholes, pursue monopolies or duopolies, generate &#8220;academic&#8221; research that doubled as corporate PR, use algorithmic discrimination to cut driver pay while hiking fares, and abandon a litany of sci-fi moonshot projects that were initially key parts of its value proposition to investors, regulators, and the public. </p><p>A gem of this seems to lend itself to Newton&#8217;s second point: look at how the companies are spending their money if you want to know what&#8217;s real. Yes, tech firms and VCs backing them often get things wrong and lose tens or hundreds of billions of dollars chasing unicorns like crypto, web3, metaverse, VR/AR&#8212;this time they're right, however. The size of the investment is "a signal that they have already seen something real." Is that true?</p><p>Uber&#8217;s size wasn&#8217;t an indicator of whether it would usher in a sustainable and profitable industry. But Uber used its size as a signal to attract the capital necessary to reshape labor markets, public transit systems, regulatory frameworks, consumer behavior, and urban governance into forms more hospitable for a business model that was previously illegal, unprofitable, unsustainable, and untenable. Similarly, Zitron&#8217;s close analysis of OpenAI&#8217;s finances suggests that&#8212;barring a series of increasingly unlikely maneuvers&#8212;OpenAI (and other genAI firms) will have to go the Uber route to survive: use Smaugian hoards of capital to realize legal and political reforms that force markets, consumers, competitors, clients, and governments into forms that can accommodate previously illegal, unprofitable, unsustainable, and untenable business models. </p><p>This brings us to the third plank of &#8220;real&#8221; AI: present-day use cases. Though Newton promised earlier to only use &#8220;AI&#8221; to refer to LLMs and generative tools, he quickly abandons that pretense when offering examples of why AI is real. His list of evidence includes some advances that center large language models and generative chatbots built on them, but many which either don&#8217;t seem to use generative AI or do so in a limited fashion that has nothing to do with the products he was defending earlier. To make matters worse, the list is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/crulge.urinal.club/post/3lcm6bg7iz22i">not great!</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-SUF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe278a82d-2fc1-4917-9f97-b3022cb5df52_825x1000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-SUF!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe278a82d-2fc1-4917-9f97-b3022cb5df52_825x1000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-SUF!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe278a82d-2fc1-4917-9f97-b3022cb5df52_825x1000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-SUF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe278a82d-2fc1-4917-9f97-b3022cb5df52_825x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-SUF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe278a82d-2fc1-4917-9f97-b3022cb5df52_825x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-SUF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe278a82d-2fc1-4917-9f97-b3022cb5df52_825x1000.jpeg" width="825" height="1000" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e278a82d-2fc1-4917-9f97-b3022cb5df52_825x1000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1000,&quot;width&quot;:825,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-SUF!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe278a82d-2fc1-4917-9f97-b3022cb5df52_825x1000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-SUF!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe278a82d-2fc1-4917-9f97-b3022cb5df52_825x1000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-SUF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe278a82d-2fc1-4917-9f97-b3022cb5df52_825x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-SUF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe278a82d-2fc1-4917-9f97-b3022cb5df52_825x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg

Does Newton&#8217;s framework offer any insight into <strong>why</strong> so many people are using generative AI products, into what workplaces are rolling them out and why, into what firms are utilizing them and why? No. Does it offer any insight into what the aforementioned quarter-trillion dollars is being spent on and why? No. Does his focus on whether critics believe AI is &#8220;real&#8221; or &#8220;fake&#8221; tell us anything about its resource intensity, technical limitations, potential applications, or harmful impacts?  No. Thus far, we are just being sold something indistinguishable from corporate copy. </p><p><strong>III. &amp; IV. </strong></p><p>These two sections are where Newton articulates what believing &#8220;AI is fake and sucks&#8221; actually means. We&#8217;ve gone over how vacuous the false dichotomy is and how empty is &#8220;real&#8221; signifier is, but maybe there is something salvageable in &#8220;fake and sucks.&#8221; In Newton&#8217;s own words, he envisions the camp as arguing something like:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>Large language models built with transformers are not technically capable of creating superintelligence, because they are predictive in nature and do not understand concepts in the way that human beings do.</p></li><li><p>Efforts to improve LLMs by increasing their model size, the amount of data they are trained on, and the computing power that goes into them <a href="https://www.platformer.news/openai-google-scaling-laws-anthropic-ai/">have begun to see diminishing returns</a>.</p></li><li><p>These limits are permanent, due to the inherent flaws of the approach, and AI companies might never find a way around them.</p></li><li><p>Silicon Valley will therefore probably never recoup its investment on AI, because creating it has been too expensive, and the products will never be good enough for most people to pay for them.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>From here, there are two more caveats. First:</p><blockquote><p>There is a fourth, rarely stated conclusion to be drawn from the above, which goes something like: Therefore, superintelligence is unlikely to arrive any time soon, if ever. LLMs are a Silicon Valley folly like so many others, and will soon go the way of NFTs and DAOs.</p></blockquote><p>Second: </p><blockquote><p>This is a view that I have come to associate with Gary Marcus. Marcus, a professor emeritus of psychology and neural science at New York University, sold a machine learning company to Uber in 2016. More recently, he has gained prominence by telling anyone who will listen that AI is &#8220;<a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/which-ceo-will-be-the-last-to-see?ref=platformer.news">wildly overhyped</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/alphaproof-alphageometry-chatgpt?ref=platformer.news">will soon flame out</a>.&#8221; (A year previously <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/what-if-generative-ai-turned-out?ref=platformer.news">he had said</a> &#8220;the whole generative AI field, at least at current valuations, could come to a fairly swift end.&#8221;) &#8230; Marcus doesn&#8217;t say that <em>AI is fake and sucks</em>, exactly. But his arguments are extremely <em>useful</em> to those who believe that AI is fake and sucks, because they give it academic credentials and a sheen of empirical rigor. And that has made him worth reading for me as I attempt to come to my own understanding of AI.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, we have something resembling an argument. Newton hones in on Marcus here to suggest that he's too dour on AI's prospects, dismisses the ubiquity of these products, hyper-fixates on its limitations, and ignores what it can&#8212;an issue because generative AI is increasingly being used to disrupt critical infrastructure at firms like Amazon. "They're staring at the floor of AI's current abilities, while each day the actual practitioners are successfully raising the ceiling." </p><p>Staring at the floor, then, means constantly pointing out a model's flaws but ignoring each iteration's new capabilities as the models grow larger and more complex. Scaling the models, increasing their size and the amount of data used to train them, would always yield improvements and unlock new use cases. Until it didn't.</p><p>When asked to cite one (1) external critic who Newton saw as in the &#8220;fake and sucks&#8221; camp on BlueSky, Newton cited two: a <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2024/11/14/openai-google-anthropic-admit-they-cant-scale-up-their-chatbots-any-further/">blog post</a> co-authored by Amy Castor and David Gerad that documents how numerous large language models are seeing diminishing improvements despite exponentially larger sets of training data. These declining returns suggest chatbots may be experiencing a scaling issue, and yet the technology firms offering these products are insisting each new model will be a massive improvement over the last (at the same time that they are searching for funding and revenues). To point this out, then, is to insist &#8220;AI is fake and sucks.&#8221;</p><p>In <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/hard-forked-casey-newtons-distorted">a lengthy response</a>, Marcus makes clear that Newton not only consistently misrepresents what Marcus believes but doesn't seem to understand basic details about AI that are crucial to the &#8220;real/dangerous&#8221; v &#8220;fake/sucks&#8221; argument. Newton proudly considers himself part of the "real and dangerous" crowd, but as Marcus points out only vaguely gestures at dangers while ignoring those that already exist: "Covert racism? Deepfakes? Propaganda? Discrimination in employment, insurance, and housing?" Marcus also points out the dichotomy comes with a glaring analytical blindspot: "thinking that if an AI is stupid (or overrated) it can't be dangerous." Newton charges the &#8220;fake and sucks&#8221; camp with a blindspot that overlooks danger but Newton&#8217;s is arguably more dangerous: his immaterial analysis would likely overlook AI-powered deepfakes, propaganda, fossil fuel extraction, insurance tech, and assassination drones, if it meant that chatbots were being used by hundreds of millions of people.</p><p>So where does this leave us? The real/fake and sucks/dangerous framework is at best useless: it overlooks financials, harms, impacts, political economy, and technical detail in favor of press releases and product launches. It bundles any technology that is compute heavy into &#8220;AI&#8221; as part of a bid to defend generative AI. It misrepresents the views of the sole critic named in its camp (Gary Marcus). If you are interested in phony comfort, this is the framework to use&#8212;not one that is skeptical of artificial intelligence.</p><p><strong>V.</strong></p><p>This final section is about what it means to "raise the ceiling" or improve the capabilities of generative AI. Here, Newton insists that OpenAI's o1 is "another possible step toward building superintelligence" but worries about how its price hike will be interpreted.</p><blockquote><p>My fear, though, will be that &#8220;AI is fake and sucks&#8221; people will see a $200 version of ChatGPT and see only desperation: a cynical effort to generate more revenue to keep the grift going a few more months until the bottom drops out. And they will continue to take a kind of phony comfort in the idea that all of this will disappear from view in the next few months, possibly forever.</p><p>In reality, I suspect that many people will be happy to pay OpenAI $200 or more to help them code faster, or solve complicated problems of math and science, or whatever else o1 turns out to excel at. And when the open-source world catches up, and anyone can download a model like that onto their laptop, I fear for the harms that could come.</p></blockquote><p>This is not just the height of Newton&#8217;s analysis, this is the limit of real/dangerous v. fake/sucks. Newton&#8217;s framework seems to view any attempt at understanding OpenAI&#8217;s financials with suspicion, and instead insists analysis should follow the most vulgar input possible: narratives about consumer behavior. That may be fine if you are angling for a job at a company&#8217;s PR shop or at some advertising agency, but one would hope a journalist or commentator might try to show some capacity for curiosity and ask even one question about why &amp; how certain products are being offered, as well as how those offerings fit into the company&#8217;s business model (or lack of one).</p><p>To this point, I would like to turn to an infinitely more useful piece of writing by <a href="https://ali-alkhatib.com/blog/defining-ai">computer scientist Ali Alkhatib</a> that hits on many of the flaws in Newton&#8217;s piece: defining what artificial intelligence is, thinking through its development and application, and using frameworks to understand why certain technologies are being pursued/deployed. I&#8217;ll quote the relevant section below:</p><blockquote><p>I think we should shed the idea that AI is a technological artifact with political features and recognize it as a political artifact through and through. AI is an ideological project to shift authority and autonomy away from individuals, towards centralized structures of power. Projects that claim to &#8220;democratize&#8221; AI routinely conflate &#8220;democratization&#8221; with &#8220;commodification&#8221;. Even open-source AI projects often borrow from libertarian ideologies to help manufacture little fiefdoms.</p><p>This way of thinking about AI (as a political project that happens to be implemented technologically in myriad ways that are inconsequential to identifying the overarching project as &#8220;AI&#8221;) brings the discipline - reaching at least as far back as the 1950s and 60s, drenched in blood from military funding - into focus as part of the same continuous tradition.</p><p>Defining AI along political and ideological language allows us to think about things <em>we experience</em> and recognize productively as AI, without needing the self-serving supervision of computer scientists to allow or direct our collective work. We can recognize, based on our own knowledge and experience as people who deal with these systems, what&#8217;s part of this overarching project of disempowerment by the way that it renders autonomy farther away from us, by the way that it alienates our authority on the subjects of our own expertise.</p><p>This framework sensitizes us to &#8220;small&#8221; systems that cause tremendous harm because of the settings in which they&#8217;re placed and the authority people place upon them; and it inoculates us against fixations on things like regulating systems just because they happened to use <code>10^26</code><a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240sb1047"> floating point calculations</a> in training - an arbitrary threshold, denoting nothing in particular, beneath which actors could (and do) cause monumental harms already, today.</p><p>Okay, that was a bit of a post. Whether you subscribe to this way of defining AI or you totally reject it, I hope I&#8217;ve made it more salient to you that you can judge frameworks entirely according to how well it helps you navigate a space you&#8217;re trying to navigate. You can reject a definition that isn&#8217;t helping you, and I would encourage you to reject mine just as readily as I rejected <em>AI Snake Oil</em>&#8217;s if it&#8217;s not serving your purposes.</p><p>I&#8217;ll wrap it up here; if you&#8217;re benefiting from some particular way of drawing a boundary around and thinking about AI, I&#8217;d really like to hear about it.</p></blockquote><p>If there is one thing you take away from my essay or Alkhatib, it&#8217;s should be this: reach for your wallet when someone starts offering simple taxonomies for understanding artificial intelligence. These technologies are complex: their origins, their development, the motivations driving their financing, the political projects they&#8217;re connected to, the products they&#8217;re integrated into. Anyone who is telling you criticism slots into &#8220;real&#8221; or &#8220;fake&#8221; or &#8220;sucks&#8221; or &#8220;dangerous&#8221; is at best a useful idiot desperate for a comforting narrative that&#8217;ll provide some phony comfort. If you&#8217;re interested in understanding the world, ignore such fools.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/the-phony-comforts-of-useful-idiots/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/the-phony-comforts-of-useful-idiots/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p>]]>

Voters can be maddening, yes. They are motivated by competing and often contradictory thoughts and impulses. But the task of democratic politics, still today as always, is to engage and persuade them. That frustrating, difficult work isn&#8217;t for everyone; those not cut out for it should see themselves off of the political scene and leave it to others. Thinking through what to do now will be difficult enough without the interjections of those who&#8217;ve convinced themselves that there&#8217;s nothing to be done.</p></blockquote><p>Adam Tooze had <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/adam-tooze/great-power-politics">a great </a><em><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/adam-tooze/great-power-politics">London Review of Books</a></em><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/adam-tooze/great-power-politics"> essay</a> before the election that surveyed what Bidenomics was: </p><blockquote><p>We can use the past tense because, whatever happens in the election, Bidenism is over. The project anchored on the long-serving senator from Delaware and Obama&#8217;s vice president had one term in it. Up until the last moments, his entourage closed ranks to deny this fact. They clung on even though, as Bob Woodward reveals in his new book, <em>War</em>, it was clear already in June 2023 that Biden was failing.<a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/adam-tooze/great-power-politics#">*</a> It wasn&#8217;t until a year later that they, unwillingly, accepted that a man born in 1942, during the autumn of Stalingrad and El Alamein, was not fit to run for president in 2024. The fact that his opponent wasn&#8217;t fit to run either is another matter.</p><p>We are left asking how this four-year period fits into recent American history and what legacy it leaves. The National Defence Industrial Strategy (NDIS) offers to do some of the work for us. Like other, better-known documents of the Biden era &#8211; Jake Sullivan&#8217;s speech on &#8216;Renewing American Economic Leadership&#8217; at the Brookings Institution in April 2023, for instance &#8211; the NDIS is historically self-conscious. The basic Biden narrative was of America&#8217;s fall from greatness, starting in the 1990s, when the industrial fabric of the nation began to fray and China&#8217;s manufacturing capacity surged. Now China and other competitors are rising fast. The home front is undermined by polarisation and social dysfunction. But, with measures such as the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act (which increased spending on semiconductor research), the bipartisan infrastructure law and the NDIS, the Biden administration was attempting a national rebuilding centred on industrial production and a revalorisation of manual work.</p></blockquote><p>Tim Barker&#8217;s <a href="https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/dealignment">essay in </a><em><a href="https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/dealignment">Sidecar</a></em> pushes against the idea that Trump&#8217;s election itself signals the emergence of a new political order:</p><blockquote><p><em>NYT</em> columnist Jamelle Bouie proclaimed that &#8216;Most of us will probably die living in the political order that will emerge out of this election&#8217;. Without giving any hostages to fortune, one can say that this is wrong. The idea of a political order, alluded to by Bouie, was introduced to the study of American politics by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr, whose first volume on the age of the New Deal was titled <em>The Crisis of the Old Order</em>. For volume two, <em>The Coming of the New Deal</em>, Schlesinger picked an epigraph from Machiavelli: &#8216;There is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things&#8217;.</p><p>Both the Age of Roosevelt and its predecessor had rested on durable class alignments. The System of 1896 was founded on the consolidation of corporate capital in a world-historical merger movement, and secured at the polls &#8211; not once, but repeatedly &#8211; with the support of industrial workers who believed they had an interest in tariff-protected industrial development. The New Deal order represented the incorporation of organized labour as a junior partner behind those businesses which would benefit from, or could at least tolerate, Roosevelt&#8217;s unprecedented combination of free trade, social welfare and trade union legality. Even the fractured age of neoliberalism was preceded, in the 1970s, by an unprecedented mobilization in which, as Thomas Edsall put it, &#8216;business refined its ability to act as a class, submerging competitive instincts in favour of joint, cooperative action in the legislative arena&#8217;.</p></blockquote><p>I liked Gabriel Winat&#8217;s <em>Dissent</em> essay as a condemnation of liberals and call to action for leftists:</p><blockquote><p>The pathologies of the Democrats, though, are in a sense not the result of errors. It is the structural role and composition of the party that produces its duplicitous and incoherent orientation. It is the mainstream party of globalized neoliberal capitalism, and at the same time, by tradition anyway, the party of the working class. As the organized power of the latter has been washed away, the commitment has become somewhat more aspirational: Harris notably cleaned up with the richest income bracket of voters. The only issues on which Harris hinted of a break with Biden concerned more favorable treatment of the billionaires who surrounded her, and her closest advisers included figures like David Plouffe, former senior vice president of Uber, and Harris&#8217;s brother-in-law Tony West, formerly the chief legal officer of Uber, who successfully urged her to drop Biden-era populism and cultivate relations with corporate allies.</p><p>The party under Biden pivoted toward economic nationalism because it didn&#8217;t have a substantive or convincing program of progressive redistribution after the failure of Build Back Better, and it couldn&#8217;t find one that would be acceptable to its corporate wing. As Bharat Ramamurti, former deputy director of the National Economic Council, <a href="https://x.com/BharatRamamurti/status/1854556125523329511">observed</a> after the election, &#8220;I wish we had enacted the housing, care, and child tax credit elements in Build Back Better so we would have had concrete cost-of-living benefits to run on. People should reflect on which part of the Democratic Party denied us those agenda items.&#8221; Instead, Biden stole Trump&#8217;s idea: exit right from neoliberalism, get the weapons factories humming. Biden sustained Trump&#8217;s massive expansion of military expenditures, with national security providing the primary ideological justification for full employment and the pursuit of progressive social goals, as it did in the Cold War. In turn, the escalating geopolitical and geoeconomic confrontation with China supplied the logic of the unwavering U.S. backing for Netanyahu&#8217;s wars: renewed great power competition intensified the imperative of consolidating a critical strategic region under U.S. hegemony. Again continuing a foreign policy formula developed by Trump, Biden&#8217;s strategy has been to pursue this goal by resolving lingering tensions between Israel and the U.S.-aligned Arab states (Saudi Arabia most significantly, with the Gulf states and Morocco taken care of under Trump and Egypt decades ago at Camp David). Accomplishing this resolution requires the termination of the Palestinian national movement, the main obstacle to such a consolidation. The idea of a Potemkin Palestinian state may return some day, but only after a severe chastising and a stark numerical reduction of the Palestinian people.</p><p>The demobilization of the Democratic electorate is thus the product of the party&#8217;s contradictory character at more than one level. The accountability of the Democrats to antagonistic constituencies produces both rhetorical incoherence&#8212;what does this party stand for?&#8212;and programmatic self-cancellation. Champions of the domestic rule of law and the rules-based international order, they engaged in a spectacular series of violations of domestic and international law. Promising a new New Deal, they admonished voters to be grateful for how well they were already doing economically. Each step taken by the party&#8217;s policymakers in pursuit of one goal imposes a limit in another direction. It is by this dynamic that a decade of (appropriate) anti-Trump hysteria led first to the adoption of parts of Trump&#8217;s program by the Democrats, and then finally his reinstallation as president at new heights of public opinion favorability. Nothing better than the real thing.</p></blockquote><h1>Essays on psyops, degrowth, surveillance capitalism, and Xi Jinping Thought</h1><h2>Society of the Psyop (Part 1-3) by Trevor Paglen</h2><p>This is a fun essay a friend who is obsessed with UFOs sent me and it is a very ambitious expansive piece of work that goes far beyond that single item:</p><blockquote><p><em>We once looked at pictures. Then, with the advent of computer vision and machine learning, pictures started looking back at us. Now, something even stranger is happening.</em></p><p><em>Generative AI, Adtech, recommendation algorithms, engagement economies, personalized search, and machine learning are inaugurating a new relationship between humans and media. Pictures are now looking at us looking at them, eliciting feedback and evolving. We&#8217;ve entered a protean, targeted visual culture that shows us what it believes we want to see, measures our reactions, then morphs itself to optimize for the reactions and actions it wants. New forms of media prod and persuade, modulate and manipulate, shaping worldviews and actions to induce us into believing what they want us to believe, and to extract value and exert influence.</em></p><p><em>How did we get here? This three-part essay traces a brief history of media, technologies, and techniques that take advantage of the malleability of perception, capitalizing on quirks in human brains to shape reality. It is a story about the manufacturing of hallucinations and the fact that, under the right conditions, hallucination and reality can become one and the same.</em></p></blockquote><h2>Marx Against Techno-Optimism by Camilla Royle</h2><p>This is essentially a review of Kohei Saito's amazing book <em>Marx in the Anthropocene: Towards the Idea of Degrowth Communism </em>and has rekindled my interest in writing something trying to tie together neo-Luddism, decelerationism, and degrowth in a serious way. UNTIL THEN, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cpe/article/43/1/94/7682492">check this out</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Saito&#8217;s points about degrowth may provoke the most discussion. The degrowthers are formally correct to say that society cannot continue to expand the use of fossil fuels without causing more catastrophic climate change. Their discussions of how we could all have a shorter working week and a better quality of life are obviously very attractive. But Saito goes further than this and asserts the existence of more general limits to growth. According to Saito, there are &#8216;planetary boundaries that exist independently of human will&#8217; (2022, p. 229). These constrain socialism&#8217;s ability to make material abundance &#8216;almost infinite&#8217; so that &#8216;the working class can enjoy the same luxurious life without natural limits&#8217; (p. 229). This review has primarily discussed Saito&#8217;s work in relation to theories of metabolism as Saito himself maintains that metabolism is central to an ecological Marxist understanding (2022, p. 19). However, his book poses a challenge to the metabolic rift school of Marxists associated with the term. In some ways it is more reminiscent of the likes of Ted Benton with its emphasis on rethinking the suppositions of traditional Marxism and on highlighting irreconcilable contradictions between the demands of capitalism and the limits posed by the natural world (Saito references Benton&#8217;s &#8216;natural limits&#8217; article briefly and approvingly on p. 15&#8212;the difference between them is that Benton thinks that Marx never recognised natural limits whereas Saito says he eventually did later in life).</p></blockquote><h2>In Defense of 'Surveillance Capitalism' by Peter K&#246;nigs</h2><p>I'm a big critic of surveillance capitalism, as I laid out in Part 2 of my AI series. I think the Zuboffian framework for understanding the effect of digital technologies on capitalism is weak and has led to a flurry of intellectual dead-ends, with Foster's version in Monthly Review being infinitely more material and illuminating in its analysis. Still, we will suffer the former for a LONG time. I found <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-024-00804-1">an essay defending/interrogating it</a> that I keep bobbing between persuasive/interesting. I will probably write some response to it later. In the meantime, check out the abstract to see if it may interest you: </p><blockquote><p>Critics of Big Tech often describe &#8216;surveillance capitalism&#8217; in grim terms, blaming it for all kinds of political and social ills. This article counters this pessimistic narrative, offering a more favorable take on companies like Google, YouTube, and Twitter/X. It argues that the downsides of surveillance capitalism are overstated, while the benefits are largely overlooked. Specifically, the article examines six critical areas: i) targeted advertising, ii) the influence of surveillance capitalism on politics, iii) its impact on mental health, iv) its connection with government surveillance, v) its effects on the rule of law and social trust, and vi) privacy concerns. For each area, it will be argued that concerns about surveillance capitalism are unfounded or exaggerated. The article also explores some benefits of the services provided by these technology companies and concludes with a discussion of the practical implications. Throughout, the article draws on empirical evidence relating to the societal and political impact of digital technologies.</p></blockquote><h2>Is Xi Jinping a Marxist? by Jude Blanchette</h2><p>An interesting review of Xi Jinping Thought with the help of two recent books on the subject: Steve Tsang and Olivia Cheung's <em>The Political Thought of Xi Jinping</em> and Ambassador Kevin Rudd's <em>On Xi Jinping: How Xi's Marxist Nationalism is Shaping China and the World</em>. <a href="https://chinabooksreview.com/2024/10/17/xi-thought/">Check it out</a>:</p><blockquote><p>But this is not Leninism for Leninism&#8217;s sake. Nor is it a continuous revolution to bring Marx&#8217;s vision of communism to China, or to realize heaven on earth. The true substance of Xi Jinping Thought is how to direct Leninism at a policy agenda focused on building and wielding comprehensive national power. While Chinese leaders and intellectuals since the late 19th century have sought to restore China&#8217;s central place in the international order, from Zeng Guofan and the Self-Strengthening Movement to Deng Xiaoping&#8217;s reforms, Xi is employing a new toolkit. He leverages cutting-edge technology, state-controlled capitalism and assertive foreign policy, with an unprecedented focus on expanding China&#8217;s influence across key global arenas. Unlike his predecessors, who often adopted more cautious or internally-focused approaches, Xi has mobilized far greater resources and directed the full machinery of the Party toward strategic ambitions on the world stage. His methods &#8212; which blend Leninist control with modern economic, technological and military prowess &#8212; represent a more aggressive and concentrated effort to reclaim China&#8217;s historical stature, with the long-term goal of challenging the current global power balance.</p></blockquote><h1>China, China, China</h1><h2>The Huawei Model by Yun Wen</h2><p>One of the first books we covered on This Machine Kills was <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thismachinekillspod/22-huawei-or-the-highway?ref=pennyfractions.ghost.io">The Huawei Model</a>, spurred by Evgeny Morozov&#8217;s <a href="https://mondediplo.com/2020/11/10huawei">essay</a> on the geopolitical context behind Huawei&#8217;s ascendance and how America&#8217;s burgeoning Cold War with China crashed up against the tech giant. How did Huawei become central to global information and communications technology infrastructure? How did this spring out of China's own attempts to develop its ICT sector and expand into foreign markets? How does Huawei pursue R&amp;D, how is it structured internally, what are its labor practices, what are its main offerings? And, of course, what does the nature of this firm and the support it gets from the China tell us about the "huawei model" development strategy.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B4YY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf05ec3d-a427-4acf-9ff6-e799e1c2f2f3_500x750.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B4YY!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf05ec3d-a427-4acf-9ff6-e799e1c2f2f3_500x750.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B4YY!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf05ec3d-a427-4acf-9ff6-e799e1c2f2f3_500x750.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B4YY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf05ec3d-a427-4acf-9ff6-e799e1c2f2f3_500x750.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B4YY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf05ec3d-a427-4acf-9ff6-e799e1c2f2f3_500x750.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B4YY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf05ec3d-a427-4acf-9ff6-e799e1c2f2f3_500x750.jpeg" width="500" height="750" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bf05ec3d-a427-4acf-9ff6-e799e1c2f2f3_500x750.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:750,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B4YY!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf05ec3d-a427-4acf-9ff6-e799e1c2f2f3_500x750.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B4YY!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf05ec3d-a427-4acf-9ff6-e799e1c2f2f3_500x750.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B4YY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf05ec3d-a427-4acf-9ff6-e799e1c2f2f3_500x750.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!B4YY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbf05ec3d-a427-4acf-9ff6-e799e1c2f2f3_500x750.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg

The string of books I&#8217;ve been reading on China lately have been an attempt to learn more about its innovation system, and this one offers a lot of interesting details through a mix of reporting &amp; analysis. Many of the details have been distilled in essays since, but a book length treatment is worth the trouble. How did TikTok become, at one point, the mos tvaluable startup in the world? How did ByteDance create so many valuable products/startups for domestic and foreign markets? What decisions drove the financing, development, and deployment of TikTok? What does China's startup ecosystem look like?</p><h1>More science fiction</h1><p>As I said in the last dispatch, I&#8217;ve been rereading the science fiction I gorged myself on when my dad used to leave me at the library for the weekend BUT I&#8217;ve also been trying to exhaust bibliographies of my favorite writers. This week is still science fiction heavy, I&#8217;m just gonna focus on stories I&#8217;ve only read for the first time recently.</p><h2>Triton by Samuel Delaney</h2><p>Elsewhere I&#8217;ve recommended other books of Delaney&#8217;s like Babel-17 or Dhalgren or Nova&#8212;each of these are masterpieces that you should check out! Triton is one I&#8217;ve never heard of, coming to me a few months ago from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9nTonnC110&amp;ab_channel=OutlawBookseller">Outlaw Bookseller</a>, one of my favorite YouTube channels about books (authors, stories, the histories and contexts of various genres, bookselling, etc.) Triton follows Bron Helstrom, a human on this moon colony that lives in an era where technology allows you to redesign nearly any aspect of your self: sexuality, gender/sex, presentation, these are all fluid in the libertine Triton society. Still Bron struggles to define himself and is in the midst of a personal crisis wrapped up in a larger political crisis (Earth vs Mars, with Triton an independent outpost). I see flashes of Bron in characters explored by Tony Tulathimutte's <em>Rejection</em>, but Triton is better understood as a response to <em>The Dispossessed: An Ambigious Utopia</em> (Triton's full name is Trouble on Triton: An Ambigious Heterotopia). Bron is a nightmare of a character, a cypher through which to view this future society; lost and aimless as various groups pull him in, draw his disgust or pity or desperate attempt to join, and as he develops a deep obsession with an artist known as The Spike.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vpaf!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d9dc27d-02e5-4a3c-a81b-699916ff503d_628x1000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vpaf!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d9dc27d-02e5-4a3c-a81b-699916ff503d_628x1000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vpaf!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d9dc27d-02e5-4a3c-a81b-699916ff503d_628x1000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vpaf!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d9dc27d-02e5-4a3c-a81b-699916ff503d_628x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vpaf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d9dc27d-02e5-4a3c-a81b-699916ff503d_628x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vpaf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d9dc27d-02e5-4a3c-a81b-699916ff503d_628x1000.jpeg" width="628" height="1000" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8d9dc27d-02e5-4a3c-a81b-699916ff503d_628x1000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1000,&quot;width&quot;:628,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Trouble on Triton: An Ambiguous Heterotopia: Delany, Samuel R., Acker,  Kathy: 9780819562982: Amazon.com: Books&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Trouble on Triton: An Ambiguous Heterotopia: Delany, Samuel R., Acker,  Kathy: 9780819562982: Amazon.com: Books" title="Trouble on Triton: An Ambiguous Heterotopia: Delany, Samuel R., Acker,  Kathy: 9780819562982: Amazon.com: Books" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vpaf!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d9dc27d-02e5-4a3c-a81b-699916ff503d_628x1000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vpaf!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d9dc27d-02e5-4a3c-a81b-699916ff503d_628x1000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vpaf!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d9dc27d-02e5-4a3c-a81b-699916ff503d_628x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Vpaf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d9dc27d-02e5-4a3c-a81b-699916ff503d_628x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg

Compton </h2><p>D.G. Compton has become a quick favorite of mine, with this being his best. Katherine Mortenhoe is a Romance novel "programmer" that leans she will die of a terminal illness in a few weeks at the ripe old age of 44 in a world with extended lifespans. Rod is a journalist who accepts an eye camera implant and is assigned to document the last few weeks of Katherine's life so that it can be turned into a reality television show (without her knowledge). Surveillance, privacy, media circuses, reality television, a great deal of what we're suffering through now ports over very nicely to this book and vice versa. The prose is beautiful for the genre, the characters are amazing, it is very very warm and alive and angry/vilotric/contempous of a society so thoroughly mediated by, well, media/mediums.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4nvf!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ec15c8f-3e7c-40f0-a09f-a03524923f5a_220x370.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4nvf!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ec15c8f-3e7c-40f0-a09f-a03524923f5a_220x370.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4nvf!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ec15c8f-3e7c-40f0-a09f-a03524923f5a_220x370.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4nvf!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ec15c8f-3e7c-40f0-a09f-a03524923f5a_220x370.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4nvf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ec15c8f-3e7c-40f0-a09f-a03524923f5a_220x370.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4nvf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ec15c8f-3e7c-40f0-a09f-a03524923f5a_220x370.jpeg" width="220" height="370" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9ec15c8f-3e7c-40f0-a09f-a03524923f5a_220x370.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:370,&quot;width&quot;:220,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The Unsleeping Eye (novel) - Wikipedia&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="The Unsleeping Eye (novel) - Wikipedia" title="The Unsleeping Eye (novel) - Wikipedia" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4nvf!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ec15c8f-3e7c-40f0-a09f-a03524923f5a_220x370.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4nvf!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ec15c8f-3e7c-40f0-a09f-a03524923f5a_220x370.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4nvf!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ec15c8f-3e7c-40f0-a09f-a03524923f5a_220x370.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4nvf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ec15c8f-3e7c-40f0-a09f-a03524923f5a_220x370.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg

AK the Savior and Issa Gold formed their duo back in 2011 and were part of a looser supergroup (Beast Coast) that included rap trio Flatbush Zombies (Meechy Darko, Zombie Juice and Erick Arc Elliott) and hip-hop collective Progressive Era (Joey Badass, Capital STEEZ, CJ Fly, Kirk Knight, and many more). Beast Coast only put out one album and did one tour together, both in summer 2019, but the various groups and members have collaborated with each other for well over a decade.</p><p>A common thread through all their music is the psychedelic influence, but I haven&#8217;t seen much talk of the granola New Age &#8220;Indigo Child&#8221; idea that dominated the music of various members and subgroups for some time. The Underachievers&#8217; debut mixtape is titled &#8220;INDIGOISM" and most members talk about elevating their consciousness, saving humanity, third eyes, New Age spirituality, and so on. Back in the 1970s, Nancy Ann Tappe&#8212;a supposed psychic who studied psychic phenomena&#8212;started developing the idea that we each had a "life color" or an aura representing our life force that had a specific color. Tappe claimed children were being born with an "indigo" color and had a life force that lent itself towards greater empathy, intelligence, intuition, spirituality, and so on. This theory has waxed and waned over the years but the most recent iteration believes there's a connection to ADD/ADHD diagnoses and the "evolution" of a new generation of humanity.</p><p>This is all bunk and hogwash, of course, but it doesn&#8217;t take much to see why it has persisted over the years. As the Skeptic's Dictionary <a href="https://skepdic.com/indigo.html">puts it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>One can understand why many parents would not want their child to be labeled as ADD or ADHD. The label implies imperfection. Some may even take it to mean the child is "damaged." Specifically, it means your child's behavior is due to a neuro-biological condition. To some, this is the same as having a malfunctioning brain or a mental disorder. Understandably, emotions run high here. Treatment of children with problems is a hot button issue for the mass media, attack lawyers, talk show hosts, columnists, and others not known for their role in clarifying complicated scientific or medical matters. Many jump on the bandwagon and attack the drug industry and psychiatrists for overdrugging our children. Opposition is fruitless, because few will listen to those who would defend those who &#8220;abuse&#8221; children. Fewer still will bother to investigate to see whether the critics know what they are talking about.</p></blockquote><p>None of this explains, however, how it creeped into so much rap. Essays that touched on this are few and far between but here&#8217;s one interview that touches on another self-professed Indigo Child&#8212;the artist Raury, whose debut EP &#8220;Indigo Child&#8221; dived deep into this sort of New Age talk. In a conversation with <em>i-d</em>, Raury <a href="https://i-d.co/article/raury-is-the-indigo-child-of-the-internet-age/">says</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Indigo children are my generation. It&#8217;s kids like me who just automatically, regardless of who they are or where they&#8217;re from, feel like something isn&#8217;t right with the normal system of life that we live in. We&#8217;re also highly inclined to be more advanced and geared toward our dreams because we have the internet. We were born with it. I literally don&#8217;t remember a world without it. And it&#8217;s thanks to the internet that I&#8217;m here, being an artist. It seems that everybody is considered either ahead of their time, or to have grown up too fast. Whether that&#8217;s good or bad, I feel that there is an extreme generational gap between us and older people. The young kids are a lot more advanced and will probably do a lot more for the future of the world. I feel like it&#8217;s a beautiful thing but also bad because you can stumble across all the wrong things earlier on. I named my EP Indigo Child to remind people that my generation isn&#8217;t hopeless.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Beyond the pseudoscience, psychic nonsense, talk of aura and light work and indigo and what not, there are a few more familiar things: frustration with the world as it is, some sort of existential dread or anxiety about childhood, and <a href="https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/malcolm-harris-kids-these-days-review-millennials-capitalism/">a vague sense that something has shifted in the way our lives are constructed</a>. If you know someone that&#8217;s written more about why this weird ass idea found an audience with these and other rap groups, let me know! For now, let&#8217;s put that aside and get into what I really want to share with everyone&#8230;the music</p><h2><strong>The Underachievers - 6th Sense</strong></h2><div id="youtube2-vt87Tc5cvf4" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;vt87Tc5cvf4&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vt87Tc5cvf4?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>A perfect example of what we&#8217;re talking about.

The track itself is off Pro Era&#8217;s only mixtape (PEEP: the aPROcalypse) and was dropped two days before the first voice&#8212;Capital STEEZ, Pro Era co-founder&#8212;killed himself. The video, which came out sometime in May 2013, serves as a memorial for STEEZ, whose verse is laid over shots of the city and a look-alike (I assume a family member?) moving about. STEEZ&#8217;s verse was one of his best and has maybe my favorite opener from him &#8220;AND I QUOTE: WE CAME LIKE THEM NIGGAS IN BOATS.&#8221; Statik Selektah&#8217;s production gives the song a sense of nostalgia that I&#8217;m sure has only grown with STEEZ&#8217;s passing. Badass is the real star, however, and maybe my favorite verse of his. I also associate this song with long walks home from school, shivering in the cold and drudging along through broken sheets of ice or the brown-black slush that would soon follow. Back when it used to snow!</p><h2><strong>Flatbush Zombies - Club Soda (feat.

Resisting AI offers stark moral clarity and analysis that lays out what&#8217;s at stake with the proliferation of algorithmic systems that are being designed and deployed to augment the discrimination, exploitation, and violence our society relies on to function. An excerpt:</p><blockquote><p>The struggle against the fascization of AI precedes AI itself. It&#8217;s not that AI first comes into existence and we then have to tackle its dodgy politics from scratch, but rather that AI is already part of the system&#8217;s ongoing violent response to the autonomous activity of ordinary people. Instead of having to invent a plethora of new remedial measures, we can build on the long history of community solidarity generated by people&#8217;s resistance to exclusion and enclosure.</p><p>The very generalizability of AI and the way it comes to bear on different communities and constituencies creates the potential for this resistance to cut across race, gender, sexuality, disability and other forms of demographic division. If the whole of society becomes subsumed by algorithmically ordered relations and enrolled in machinic optimization, then society as a whole also becomes a site for contesting the imposition of those power relations. AI&#8217;s generalizability and its intensification of social crisis creates a position from which to question the totality of social relations.</p></blockquote><p>One of Trump&#8217;s earliest beneficiaries will certainly be the financiers, startups, and firms centered on artificial intelligence. Trump surrogates like Marc Andreessen who are <a href="https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/">keen on making billions off of the sector</a> (and seek to use it to <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">further their political projects</a>) have made clear they believe regulations are anti-American (and somehow akin to murder). Silicon Valley&#8217;s premiere reactionaries are eager to subordinating every sphere of daily life to artificial intelligence, and in increasingly violent ways: to terrorize migrants, non-White communities, workers, and political opponents, to name a few.</p><p>McQuillain&#8217;s book offers a lucid framework for understanding the technology at play here, its political/social/economic/cultural consequences, the various actors shaping and driving its development, as well as the ends to which it is being deployed. </p><p>Artificial intelligence as it's currently constituted is interested in prediction, surveillance, discrimination, securitization, dispossession, terror, regimentation, and a host of other phenomena that are as far removed from social good as you can imagine. In the driver's seat are the latest wave of capitalists to commit themselves towards re-legitimizing the purer forms of hierarchal rule and spectacular violence capitalism enjoyed until it was tainted by democracy. The clearer we are about this, the easier it will be for us to talk about the algorithmic systems we oppose and the algorithmic systems we desire&#8212;as well as how to get there!</p><p>Read the book!! It has had a profound influence on me and structures a great deal of how I think about algorithmic systems.</p><h3><a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/9781517918149/cyberlibertarianism/">Cyberlibertarianism: The Right-Wing Politics of Digital Technology</a> by David Golumbia</h3><p>There is a huge hole in technology criticism since David Golumbia&#8217;s passing. We are blessed to get one last book from him, a forthcoming magnum opus about the hodgepodge of ideas, actors, movements, historical forces, and technologies crashing down on us at the moment. I encourage you to check out all of his work, but especially <em><a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/9781517901806/the-politics-of-bitcoin/">The Politics of Bitcoin</a></em> which still remains one of the most authoritative explanations of crypto&#8217;s fundamentally right-wing orientation (no matter what its loudest shills insist).</p><p>An excerpt: </p><blockquote><p>One of cyberlibertarianism&#8217;s chief effects is to minimize or eliminate the power of democratic governments to choose which technologies fit their vision of a healthy society. In practice, this means quieting or altogether muting the voices of those who insist that democracies must have the power to decide which technologies are beneficial for their citizens. For democracy to mean anything, there must be actual political mechanisms (legislative, regulatory, and judicial) through which governments can exercise this power beyond the almost exclusively deregulated free markets that cyber- libertarianism advocates. Some versions of democratic oversight of technology take the form of abolition (Benjamin 2019; Selinger and Hartzog 2019; Stark and Hutson 2022); others, heavy regulation (Bracha and Pasquale 2008; Pasquale 2016, 2020) or licensure (Pasquale 2021). These approaches have been so thoroughly muted by cyberlibertarian discourse that many of us do not even appreciate that they are possible. Not only are they possible, but the future of democracy depends on the ability of citizens to reclaim that power from the companies and technologists that have so effectively undermined it.</p></blockquote><p>If this interests you, check out Golumbia&#8217;s talk on the subject. The book comes out November 12.</p><div id="youtube2-f4pmXl4RCcE" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;f4pmXl4RCcE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f4pmXl4RCcE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><h1>Posthuman science fiction</h1><h3>Radix by A. A. Attanasio</h3><p>I've been revisiting science fiction that was influential to me as a child: for the first few years I started reading the genre, I was incredibly obsessed with posthuman narratives that featured some sort of artificial god. I was getting seduced by the Singularity cult, I was losing my faith in God, I found it very fun and fascinating to imagine what sort of societies would emerge if God were tangible and real. Save for a few, their plots have escaped me so I thought it would be a fun chance to see what ideas/lessons made their way into my worldview.</p><p>Radix was not the first I read but one of the weirdest ones by far. I won&#8217;t spoil much: the plot takes place in a far future Earth and follows a child straight out of A Clockwork Orange as he becomes a human/man/god. It&#8217;s written by a mystic who lives in Hawaii and believes in a syncretic version of various Eastern religions as far as I can tell (another thread that pops up again and again in science fiction I like is a universe where sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from nature, and nature accommodates divine acts).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D5K_!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9255da3b-fa09-412e-af43-d6c33420f811_260x387.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D5K_!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9255da3b-fa09-412e-af43-d6c33420f811_260x387.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D5K_!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9255da3b-fa09-412e-af43-d6c33420f811_260x387.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D5K_!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9255da3b-fa09-412e-af43-d6c33420f811_260x387.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D5K_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9255da3b-fa09-412e-af43-d6c33420f811_260x387.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D5K_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9255da3b-fa09-412e-af43-d6c33420f811_260x387.jpeg" width="260" height="387" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9255da3b-fa09-412e-af43-d6c33420f811_260x387.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:387,&quot;width&quot;:260,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:46027,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D5K_!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9255da3b-fa09-412e-af43-d6c33420f811_260x387.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D5K_!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9255da3b-fa09-412e-af43-d6c33420f811_260x387.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D5K_!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9255da3b-fa09-412e-af43-d6c33420f811_260x387.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D5K_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9255da3b-fa09-412e-af43-d6c33420f811_260x387.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg

Great song though.</p><h1>Brazilian &amp; Japanese jazz / funk</h1><p>One piece of music <a href="https://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/10110/1/Lorenz2007.pdf">music ethnography</a> I highly recommend looks at return migration between Japan and Brazil, the construction of race and national identity in Brazil, and the role of music in identity formation in a country as vast and diverse as Brazil. Specifically, the focus is on Japanese Brazilians&#8212;who represent the largest population of Japanese descent outside of Japan (about 2 million)&#8212;living in Sao Paolo between 1990 and the early 2000s.</p><p>As fascinating as that paper was, it didn&#8217;t really get me to listen into much more beyond what little I did (some Brazilian funk and psychedelic rock + Japanese jazz). It wasn&#8217;t until about two years ago, around the time I truly dove into city pop, that until Youtube&#8217;s algorithm started <strong>aggressively</strong> pushing cross-pollinated Brazilian and Japanese jazz to me and introducing me to some of my favorite songs/albums/genres since. Here I&#8217;ll offer a two recommendations from my favorite artist in this strain, Masayoshi Takanaka:</p><div id="youtube2-_znPZ7BeEFs" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;_znPZ7BeEFs&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_znPZ7BeEFs?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>This song is off my favorite album from him, Brasilian Skies! It&#8217;s also my favorite Takanaka song.

These terms, and much of the discourse around artificial intelligence, trick us into naturalizing industry-favored ways of discussing, thinking, critiquing, and developing algorithmic and automated systems that converge with the interests of large corporations.</p><blockquote><p>Our lack of self-consciousness in using, or consuming, language that takes machine intelligence for granted is not something that we have co-evolved in response to actual advances in computational sophistication of the kind that Turing, and others, anticipated. Rather it is something to which we have been compelled in large part through the marketing campaigns, and market control, of tech companies selling computing products whose novelty lies not in any kind of scientific discovery, but in the application of turbocharged processing power to the massive datasets that a yawning governance vacuum has allowed corporations to generate and/or extract. This is the kind of technology now sold under the umbrella term "artificial intelligence."</p></blockquote><p>In its place, Tucker calls for a "Baldwin Test"&#8212;a commitment to using language that springs from real-life experiences with these technologies instead of corporate talking points. Think of it as a creative practice informed by a few fundamental guidelines:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>(1) Be as specific as possible about what the technology in question is and how it works.</strong></p><p><strong>(2) Identify any obstacles to our own understanding of a technology that result from failures of corporate or government transparency.</strong></p><p><strong>(3) Name the corporations responsible for creating and spreading the technological product.</strong></p><p><strong>(4) Attribute agency to the human actors building and using the technology, never to the technology itself.</strong></p></blockquote><p>What we call "artificial intelligence" has little to do with intelligence itself, whether we're talking about sparks of insight, boredom, delusion, or alternative forms (human or otherwise). Instead, it is concerned with narrow types of cognitive activity (e.g., pattern recognition) in pursuit of products that render humans more calculable, enabling prediction and replication. When told that ChatGPT can reason, or that our generative chatbots suffer from hallucinations, it's to trap us in a closed-off imaginative space that large tech firms have painstakingly cultivated. Certain assumptions hold there (like the idea that computational infrastructure should solely be in the hands of large corporations or that certain types of "AI" are capable of thought) and go a long way towards shaping what sorts of technologies get envisioned, financed, designed, developed, deployed&#8212;and to what ends. Corporations flooding the zone with propaganda about the inevitability of superhuman intelligence or the current capacity of their products to "think" are, ultimately, part of a long lineage of technologies concerned with cultivating social control.</p><p>Social control is embedded in the blueprint of modern computation, specifically through Charles Babbage and his calculation engines&#8212;tools first and foremost concerned with labor discipline and automation. As Meredith Whittaker<a href="https://logicmag.io/supa-dupa-skies/origin-stories-plantations-computers-and-industrial-control/"> explains</a>, these tools "directly encoded" Adam Smith's theories of labor division and built on contemporary methods advancing labor control.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>They were prefigured on the plantation, developed first as technologies to control enslaved people. Issues alive in the present&#8212;like worker surveillance, workplace automation, and the computationally mediated restructuring of traditional employment as "gig work"&#8212;echo the way that computational thinking historically emerges as a mode of control during the "age of abolition," in the early nineteenth century.</p></blockquote><p>Whittaker's argument is a straightforward one: methods deployed on plantations to control and maximize the labor of enslaved Black people were transferred to industry for use on "free" (that is, not enslaved) white workers. Contemporaneously, plantations were understood to be "modern industrial undertakings" integral to developing the forms of surveillance, regimentation, labor division, rules, and regulations that'd give way to "scientific" management of industrial labor. Enter Babbage, who, like plantation overseers, saw worker surveillance and control as "central" to "labor arrangements, alongside distinct regimes of violence and discipline calibrated to increase profits and productivity."&nbsp;</p><p>Debates over abolition raised existential questions about the future of Britain's empire, namely, how could international preeminence be maintained without racialized, enslaved labor? And so, Babbage sought to solve the "labor question" with calculating engines that would standardize and discipline work into forms that supported British industry, capitalism, and imperial ambitions. Babbage's machines depended on automation, which in turn depended on the division and control of labor so that work could be made "observable, quantifiable, and controllable." Even surveillance, it was hoped, would someday be automated, allowing new instruments for disciplining workers and discouraging labor organizing amongst workers could be devised. Technological innovation would be deployed to reshape new forms of labor into older ones, preserving familiar forms of exploitation while experimenting with novel ones oriented towards similar ends.</p><p>Modern computation is born from an explicit attempt to replicate lucrative, violent forms of labor exploitation for the British Empire in the face of worker revolts and abolition movements. Anyone familiar with how automated systems are used to<a href="https://www.yalejreg.com/bulletin/belaboring-the-algorithm-artificial-intelligence-and-labor-unions/"> suppress worker organizing</a>, generate<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/01/the-gospel-how-israel-uses-ai-to-select-bombing-targets"> kill lists</a> to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes"> justify the targeting of civilians</a>,<a href="https://www.govexec.com/technology/2024/03/future-border-patrol-ai-always-watching/395167/"> militarize borders</a>, and<a href="https://mijente.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Automating-Deportation.pdf"> terrorize migrants</a> will not be surprised that there's a direct link here. We can go a bit further, however. Take the core argument in Matteo Pasquinelli's <em>The Eye of the Master</em>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>the inner code of AI is constituted not by the imitation of biological intelligence but by the intelligence of labor and social relations. Today, it should be evident that AI is a project to capture the knowledge expressed through individual and collective behaviours and encode it into algorithmic models to automate the most diverse tasks: from image recognition and object manipulation to language translation and decision-making.</p></blockquote><p>Here emerges one reason to use the term "artificial intelligence." We drown in corporate propaganda about the high-minded quest to build human and superhuman intelligences. Look past the hype, and you will recognize a grand capitalist project that pursues labor automation alongside the imposition of hierarchies and disciplinary mechanisms that preserve, expand, or re-legitimize forms of social control. Capitalists in the 19th and 20th centuries ostensibly used statistical methods to measure intelligence, yet actually served to reinforce pre-existing forms of discrimination with skill classifications. "Artificial intelligence" can be thought of as the 21st-century iteration of this project.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>AI continues this process of encoding social hierarchies and discriminating among the labour force by imposing indirectly a metrics of intelligence. The class, gender, and racial bias that AI systems notoriously amplify should not only be considered a technical flaw, but an intrinsic discriminatory feature of automation in a capitalist context.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>What we call artificial intelligence (Pasquinelli's "eye of the master") lends itself towards intensifying capitalist control over labor and social relations, innovating new forms of discipline and surveillance, and creating new relations that preserve the exploitation necessary to keep things chugging along. Automation doesn't replace workers but "multiplies and governs them anew." And so we are inundated with Potemkin AI (software that relies heavily on human labor but pretends to be powered by sophisticated software). Global computational infrastructure&#8212;data, servers, sensors, networks, cables, and so on&#8212;are maintained by an "army of 'ghost workers'" spread across the Global South in refugee camps, prisons, and workplaces that resemble plantations (with counterparts in the Global North subjected to similar conditions). To sustain these restructured labor relations, workplaces, and markets, we increasingly see flesh and blood managers replaced with algorithmic overseers bolstered by surveillance and social control. The experiences of app-based ride-hail in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/25/india-gig-workers-problems/"> New Delhi</a> and<a href="https://columbialawreview.org/content/on-algorithmic-wage-discrimination/"> New York Cit</a>y or data labelers in<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/28/scale-ai-remotasks-philippines-artificial-intelligence/"> Southeast Asia</a> and<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/remotasks-ai-expert-data-labor/"> Europe</a> are the rule, not the exception: "artificial intelligence" doesn't describe attempts to mimic human intelligence but should be used to describe the most recent iteration of a long-standing project to subordinate humanity to certain power relations that benefit Silicon Valley capitalists.&nbsp;</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><h3><em>Surveillance capitalism vs techno-feudalism vs techno-authoritarianism</em></h3><p>Understanding those power relations requires we spend some time interrogating what Silicon Valley is exactly? From <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/san-francisco-silicon-valley-eugenics/">its earliest days</a>, the question has plagued a growing host of beings under Earth's firmament: the native peoples who lived in California, the settlers who exterminated them, the soon-to-be-sacrificed ecology, the migrants whose bodies (then and now) fueled its metastasis, the eugenicists whose dreams sustained it, the state planners who subsidized it, the financiers who speculated on it, and the consumers who sometimes suffer sometimes worship it.&nbsp;</p><p>The question's stakes have only grown with the years. Despite cycles of staggered layoffs and devaluations, Palo Alto still aspires to control the commanding heights of the economy. The sector boasts tens of trillions of dollars of value, the region hundreds of thousands of jobs, and the people synonymous with both (venture capitalists, founders, tech executives, etc.) have integrated themselves into increasingly rarefied circles of power and are slowly restructuring our politics, culture, economy, social relations, and legal system to their benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>It matters, then, what we think of Silicon Valley and its operations because that will, in turn, structure the nature of the response. Is Silicon Valley to be expropriated or exulted? Will we subject it to a controlled demolition, or should society be remade in its image? Are we satisfied with this nexus of capital, technology, and power, or are we interested in another mode of technological development?</p><p>Small wonder then that, despite their best efforts, the past few years have seen many critics and sycophants start to sound like one another. Capitalism, they insist, is coming to an end because our powerful digital technologies are unraveling the mode of production that has come to dominate Earth these past few centuries. Surveillance capitalism, techno-feudalism, and techno-authoritarianism are dialects that share the same mother tongue: an artificial language incapable of accurately describing our reality. The longer we cling to them, the harder we will find it to accurately assess what exactly we take issue with and what to do about it.</p><p>The most well-known of these theories comes to us from Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff's 2018 brick of a book (and title), The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power. In it, she insists capitalists have leveraged digital technologies to expand computational resources, develop data analytics tools, and&#8212;most importantly&#8212;generate new digital services. In the beginning, Zuboff tells us, there was Google's behavioral value reinvestment cycle. User activities like search queries generated data that was analyzed to improve digital experiences or offer new ones. This drew more users, yielded more data, and so grew the Edenic digital paradise. Google needed to make money from this cycle, so it introduced a snake into the garden through advertisements. Then Google made a fateful discovery: "data exhaust," or the byproduct of user digital behavior, was not waste to be expelled but gold to be mined. Web searches don't just generate results; they generate data: the way you type your query, the heatmap of your mouse, the pages you do or don't visit, and more. This exhaust was actually a "behavioral surplus" capable of bolstering Google's burgeoning advertising business by incorporating predictive modeling based on data its users generated. This, Zuboff laments, sealed the deal: Google abandoned the behavioral value reinvestment cycle for a behavioral surplus business model. It began to prey on its users, hunting for more behavioral surplus and investing in greater tools of surveillance, accumulating "surveillance capital" and developing an expansive extractive and predictive infrastructure eventually aimed at influencing and determining human behavior. Goodbye capitalism, hello surveillance capitalism.</p><p>While the book received widespread praise, it was met with criticism from fellow academics and tech critics. Kirstie Ball, professor at the University of St. Andrews, <a href="https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/surveillance-and-society/article/view/13126/8502">notes</a> the book's refusal to cite relevant surveillance literature, which ends up duplicating numerous arguments that weaken the tome and leave it offering embarrassingly little in terms of concrete next steps. Ball chalks this up, ultimately, to the text being "intended as a wake-up call for the educated business reader to recognize the massive power of the tech platforms." It may provoke some reflection, but ultimately "is more likely to be found in an airport bookshop than in a learned library."&nbsp;</p><p>Blayne Haggart, professor at Brock University, <a href="https://blaynehaggart.com/2019/02/15/evaluating-scholarship-or-why-i-wont-be-teaching-shoshana-zuboffs-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism/">goes a bit further</a> in sharing that he wouldn't be teaching it because "as an academic work, it falls far short of the standards to which we should hold ourselves." He echoes Balls' concerns about citation and engagement with literature but adds that Zuboff goes to great lengths to obscure her own analytical framework and often relies on hyperbole when evidence is scant.&nbsp;</p><p>One example Haggart offers is that Zuboff compares people under surveillance capitalism to poached elephants. She envisions the poachers as some Big Other&#8212;in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1057/jit.2015.5">a 2015 article</a>, she defined this as "a new universal architecture existing somewhere between nature and God." Big Other "poaches our behavior for surplus and leaves behind all the meaning lodged in our bodies, our brains, and our beating hearts." We are not the product; we are an abandoned elephant carcass. An existential metaphor that suggests little is to be done, Haggart notes, but a simplistic one that prevents us from thinking clearly about this issue. If one remembers that some people enjoy social media despite its negative externalities, then capitalist reformers might pursue well-established policy solutions constructed for this very type of predicament: taxes or regulation or abolition of the enterprise entirely.&nbsp;</p><p>There are other criticisms of Zuboff's book and theory. The major one comes from tech critic Evgeny Morozov's <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/capitalisms-new-clothes-morozov">14-part, 16,000-word review</a> that interrogates the foundations of Zuboff's argument. Zuboff's theory, he observes, relies on a certain way of seeing capitalism: that its dysfunction is not a product of historical or even systemic features&#8212;such as deindustrialization or profit-seeking&#8212;but rather "the avoidable consequences of particular organizational arrangements, which, while having their uses in earlier eras, could now be made obsolete with information technology." At play here, also, is an intellectual genealogy stretching back to Havard business history professor Alfred Chandler and his mentor, sociologist Talcott Parsons; social systems function because they have specific needs satisfied by specific parts&#8212;history alters those needs, which alters the functioning of those parts, which forces society to adapt. Chandler's own grand theory of "managerial capitalism" was a tautological mess: an analytical model of history that ignored power relations, prioritized technological change, ignored evidence that inconvenienced the core premise that sprang its inquiry and could not recognize it was analyzing <em>capitalism</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Such is the thrust of Zuboff's work. Surveillance capitalism is driven by the imperatives of surveillance capitalism, which narrows her inquiry to relationships between firms extracting behavioral surplus from users and ignores vast swaths of the digital economy. We discard the geopolitics that helped catalyze Silicon Valley, the sources of capital that fuel its startups, the labor relations at major platforms that carve up daily life, the assetization schemes ranging from crypto to nature itself, the effects of concentrated ownership of computational resources, and more. In effect, we hyperfocus on specific phenomena (surveillance by advertiser giants) in ways that normalize consequential phenomena (as well as other types of surveillance!) happening elsewhere in the digital economy because they do not fit into the theory. However, their inability to fit into surveillance capitalism's theorization does not mean their effects on our politics, labor relations, social lives, culture, economy, and ecology are any less real&#8212;just that surveillance capitalism is likely a useless theory.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite Morozov's field dressing, Zuboff's surveillance capitalism has been influential enough to regress our understanding of the digital economy. Before we turn to Zuboff's influence, it's worth looking at <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/">a </a><em><a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/">different</a></em><a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/"> surveillance capitalism</a> offered up by John Bellamy Foster and Robert W. McChesney at the <em>Monthly Review</em>.</p><p>Foster and McChesney's 2014 essay is a lengthy one with a simple premise: World War 2 lifted the U.S. economy out of the Great Depression into hegemonic supremacy, but state planners were still concerned that this would be temporary because "domestic demand would be insufficient to absorb the enormous and growing potential economic surplus generated by the production system, thereby leading to a renewed condition of economic stagnation and depression." To that end, planners in industry and government organized three major campaigns to absorb that surplus: a corporate marketing revolution via Madison Avenue, a military-industrial complex committed to imperial control of markets abroad, and technological innovation, and when those two efforts waned, the ascent of financialization emerged.&nbsp;</p><p>Marketing required the technical development of "a highly organized system of customer surveillance, targeting propaganda, and psychological manipulation of populations." At the same time, it transformed capitalist competition as collusion among oligopolies ensured prices only went upwards, and fights instead were over "market share for particular brands," which required product differentiation, which intensified pressure on developing communications technologies that could create and preserve certain consumer groups, which accelerated the privatization of broadcasting and previously open space to accommodate ever-growing advertising and marketing efforts.</p><p>The second pillar of Foster and McChansey's "surveillance capitalism"&#8212;a permanent warfare state&#8212;was, ironically enough, founded by General Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1946 in a memo on the subject of "Scientific and Technological Resources as Military Assets." Nearly 15 years before he warned about the "military-industrial complex," Eisenhower insisted national security depended on the creation of a massive apparatus that marshaled civilian scientists alongside private firms and contractors into a tight and collaborative relationship. The Second World War's subordination of industrial capacity and scientific innovation was to be replicated and sustained indefinitely, calling on new institutions and new technologies. Groups like the Council of Economic Advisers to help chart a course for military Keynesianism, institutions like the National Security Council to produce documents like NSC-68, which called for a geopolitical strategy that justified massive rearmament for national and economic security, and agencies like the National Security Agency to spearhead electronic surveillance at home and abroad. A desire for social control, whether to crush political enemies or galvanize consumer activity, spurred the creation of national electronic surveillance programs and computer systems to transmit intelligence rapidly (MINARET, the proto-internet ARPANET, ECHELON, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>The third pillar, financialization, emerges when the first two begin to falter during the neoliberal era as financial institutions create speculative products for capital to invest in, but its high-speed computer networks add an accelerant to the fire. "Like advertising and national security, it had an insatiable need for data," Foster and McChesney write. "Its profitable expansion relied heavily on the securitization of household mortgages; a vast extension of credit-card usage; and the growth of health insurance and pension funds, student loans, and other elements of personal finance." The aggregation of financial transaction data picks up exponentially, becoming common practice in major corporations and spurring an entire industry of data mining, data analytics, data brokerage, and the promise of "premium proprietary behavioral insights."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>From that quick look at the alternative surveillance capitalism, we get a sense of how much is lost in Zuboff's truncated history, given its singular focus on major Internet firms&#8212;specifically Google and Facebook&#8212;and on much more recent encounters with the security state, specifically 9/11 and its aftermath. Ignoring that history deprives us of a chance to appreciate how fundamental surveillance has been to capitalism since World War Two. It also means that in losing sight of the origins of that influence, we lose sight of points to attack if we are interested in treating the illness instead of a few symptoms.</p><p>Chief among Zuboff's heirs are the techno-feudalists, tech critics who argue capitalism is dead and Big Tech has killed it. To their credit, the techno-feudalist engagement with history, economics, politics is substantial compared to Zuboff's. In their telling, capitalists&#8212;specifically tech capitalists&#8212;no longer reinvest their profits to produce more, but instead create platform monopolies that resemble feudal fiefs to generate rents, not profits, through monopolies and total control over the value generated by workers and consumers.</p><p>Former Greek finance minister Yanis Vaorufakis argues in his new book, <em>Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism</em>, that our digital overlords ("cloud capitalists") leverage "cloud capital&#8221; to create algorithms that predict and manipulate our behavior, as well as platforms to exploit workers ("cloud proles")&nbsp; and trapped users who generate data as a form of, typically, unpaid labor ("cloud serfs"). In his 2020 book "Technof&#233;odalisme: Critique de l'&#201;conomie Num&#233;rique," 2022 essays in the New Left Review debating this concept, and a recently published book "How Silicon Valley Unleashed Techno-Feudalism" French economist Cedric Durand goes to great lengths to ascertain why capitalism seems to have has shifted from reinvesting in production to supporting regimes of intangible (digital) asset monopolies underwritten by state coercion that have given rise to various methods of rents instead of profit-seeking competition.&nbsp;</p><p>As Malcolm Harris <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/what-is-technofeudalism.html">writes</a> for NYMag, it seems to be that technofeudalists "have a bad habit of repeating the industry's self-promotional puffery." They align with investors in insisting that computation has transformed capitalism, arguing that the anti-competitive practices of firms like Amazon, Google, and Facebook are evidence of their deviation from capitalism. As Harris points out, the tech firms themselves are renters&#8212;they do not even control most of the computational resources that sustain their operations. As Cory Doctorow <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">points out</a> in his book <em>How to Destroy Surveillance Capitalism</em>, while social control is real, algorithmic social control seems to be a marketing strategy to sustain the multitude of inflated industries and corporate valuations reliant on these claims.</p><p>The techno-feudalists&#8212;largely Marxist scholars building on Zuboff, a decidedly non-Marxist scholar&#8212;may yet spawn their own successors among liberals too. In <em>The Atlantic</em>, executive editor Adrienne LaFrance <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/03/facebook-meta-silicon-valley-politics/677168/">penned</a> a February 2024 titled: "The Rise of Techno-authoritarianism" argues Silicon Valley technocrats are a threat to democracy because they do not believe in it, instead they believe in themselves.</p><blockquote><p>Many of them profess unconditional support for free speech, but are vindictive toward those who say things that do not flatter them. They tend to hold eccentric beliefs: that technological progress of any kind is unreservedly and inherently good; that you should always build it, simply because you can; that frictionless information flow is the highest value regardless of the information's quality; that privacy is an archaic concept; that we should welcome the day when machine intelligence surpasses our own. And above all, that their power should be unconstrained. The systems they&#8217;ve built or are building&#8212;to rewire communications, remake human social networks, insinuate artificial intelligence into daily life, and more&#8212;impose these beliefs on the population, which is neither consulted nor, usually, meaningfully informed. All this, and they still attempt to perpetuate the absurd myth that they are the swashbuckling underdogs.</p></blockquote><p>It is true that Silicon Valley is home to a horde of reactionaries that pine for a modernity free of liberalism, as well as gripped by a delusion that society would be best served under their dominion. But why? If we are going to offer a theory such as techno-authoritarianism, we have to have some theory about <em>why</em> there is such a break. LaFrance offers us a tautology: these individuals accelerating the pace of our innovation and the triumph of digital technologies owe it to ideas that prioritize accelerating our innovation and the triumph of digital technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>The sad truth is this: Silicon Valley and its reactionaries are chickens coming home to roost. Silicon Valley is not some Promethean flame we smuggled from Olympos. Technology is not some primordial force corrupted by libertarian nerds with too much money. It's of the real world, it's material, it's influenced by the forces of history as much as anything else. Those forces come out of choosing to prioritize technology that helps us undertake surveillance for commerce, advertising, imperial adventure, speculation, and political suppression. The existential threat posed by today's tech capitalist overlords will get much worse. The funny ideas they have about their divine right to rule, their suspicion of competition and democracy, and other people who do not look like them&#8212;well, that's how we got here in the first place.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/ai-slavery-surveillance-and-capitalism/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/ai-slavery-surveillance-and-capitalism/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p><em>And we are back! Thanks to all of you who remained subscribers all this time, I appreciate your support more than you can know! If you like this essay and want to support me, consider becoming a paid subscriber to help support my work.</em></p><p><em>Today&#8217;s post consists of two notes from a series I&#8217;m working on that examines various ways some might think about artificial intelligence. The full series will be published at Security in Context soon, where I&#8217;m working as a senior researcher.</em></p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>AI == life engineering (or AI as a vector to revitalize eugenics)</strong></h2><p>I first spotted this one in Paris Marx's <em>Disconnect</em><a href="https://disconnect.blog/roundup-is-the-tech-antitrust-era-waning/">blog</a>: NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang suggesting "life engineering" would be made possible by artificial intelligence:</p><blockquote><p>Applying this technology and advancing it further for some of the most challenging and pressing issues of our times&#8212;whether it's digital biology or healthcare&#8212;is some of our best futures. I can't imagine what we're going to be like in 10 years when we apply artificial intelligence to the field of biology and for us to move beyond calling it life sciences to life engineering. And for us to understand biology the way we understand many other fields of science would be incredible. And so I think that's probably our single greatest potential of helping and we're working on it.</p></blockquote><p>Whether Huang realizes it or not, as Paris points out, such talk is "very much in line with using the veneer of tech to revitalize the eugenics movement." Silicon Valley and its various offshoots will be quick to insist they&#8217;re interested in something closer to eugenic&#8217;s supposedly progressive origins&#8212;in <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/inside-the-dark-biohacked-heart-of-silicon-valley">hacking your biology</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jAekMUKUnw&amp;ab_channel=BryanJohnson">improving your erections</a>, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/silicon-valleys-quest-to-live-forever">killing Death</a>, and becoming an immortal computer until the universe&#8217;s heat death or whatever. There&#8217;s little reason to buy into that lark, however.</p><p>In <em>The Baffler</em>, Gaby del Valle <a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/live-free-or-dei-del-valle">writes</a> about the recent mainstreaming of Great Replacement Theory&#8212;the idea that there is a secret cabal flooding the West with coloreds to permanently disempower and/or destroy the white race. This fits right into the recent backlash to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies which Great Replacement-pilled opponents bemoan are ignorant of an inescapable truth: &#8220;differences between white Americans and everyone else aren't merely cultural but genetic, immutable, and incapable of being assimilated away."&nbsp;</p><p>As journalists like <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/168125/david-sacks-elon-musk-peter-thiel">Jacob Silverman</a> and <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/183971/jd-vance-weird-terrifying-techno-authoritarian-ideas">Gil Duran</a> and Eoin Higgins have documented at length, some of Silicon Valley&#8217;s more prominent investors, thought leaders, founders, and zealots take these ideas a step further: they see themselves as the<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/artificial-intelligence-silicon-valley/"> vanguard of a reactionary backlash against liberalism itself</a>. America will be saved from the fate of Eurabia only by the re-legitimization of caste, aristocratic rule, and pre-capitalist social relations. The supposed superiority of the white race has not made these <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/2023/10/techno-optimism-is-not-something-you-should-believe-in">screeds</a> any more <a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/curtis-yarvin-thiel-carlyle-monarchism-reactionary">coherent</a>, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped their popularity from growing.</p><p>Still, we shouldn&#8217;t make the mistake of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/03/facebook-meta-silicon-valley-politics/677168/">suggesting this is a novel development</a>&#8212;or that eugenics has some progressive origin story. Malcolm Harris&#8217; <em>Palo Alto</em> and Grey Berchin&#8217;s <em>Imperial San Francisco</em> are both magisterial histories that highlight how the material and ideological roots of a Silicon Valley interested in race science, eugenics, and winning the war against liberalism <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/san-francisco-silicon-valley-eugenics/">go back to California&#8217;s colonial settlements</a>. <em>Palo Alto</em> itself makes painfully clear that &#8220;progressive&#8221; eugenics never existed, showing how ideas about improving humanity (and early experiments doing so) were always pregnant with race science or an obsessive focus on racial difference. And even if you hone in on something as recent as the modern venture capital industry that finances Silicon Valley, the shock some express at the turn towards Trump makes no sense considering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/26/silicon-valley-tech-market-donald-trump-joe-biden-wealth-tax-big-tech-venture-capitalists">the history</a> and <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2024/09/19/venture-backed-trumpism-ben-tarnoff/">political objectives</a> of its various actors&#8212;they are concerned with preserving the position of those who look like them and live like them and think like them.</p><p>While none of this inspires confidence that anything Silicon Valley produces can ever be <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/03/silicon-valley-bank-rescue-venture-capital-calacanis-sacks-ackman-tantrum.html">free of a sulfuric odor</a>, it doesn&#8217;t outright condemn artificial intelligence. One popular critical pathway for that project runs through <a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/13636">the work of Timnit Gebru and &#201;mile Torres</a>, who assert that the ideas animating the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) are part of a TESCERAL bundle (transhumanism, extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmismism, rationalism, effective altruism, and longtermism) shaped by a second wave eugenics movement. Whereas first wave eugenics was concerned with creating a superior "human stock" through social engineering, the second wave is more interested in genetic engineering and biotechnology to create "posthuman" species as well as machine gods.</p><p>So while &#8220;life engineering&#8221; in the short-term may refer to efforts to improve our lifespans, vitality, resilience, cognition, and so on, it&#8217;s not clear why that should be taken seriously. If you look at the Valley&#8217;s origins, dominant ideologies, material structure, culture, prominent networks, and a host of other composite features, you quickly find grooves that easily plug &#8220;life engineering&#8221; into selective breeding, skull measuring, biological essentialism, race science, and eugenic projects t lend themselves to preserving power and privilege for those who are inherently worthy (by virtue of genetics, heritage, race, class, and other sharp lines of differentiation). None of this even begins to get into concrete and ongoing ways artificial intelligence is being used to pursue <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00287-024-01569-9">life engineering</a>&#8212;that is, the ways in which it is used to structure the allocation of resources, social relations, market forces, urban design, medical care, regulatory frameworks, cultural production, and so much more. We will touch on that in later parts.&nbsp;</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">The Tech Bubble is supported by readers like you!

After two generations of Internet illiteracy, an embrace of new tools for empowerment and understanding can help salvage not only the Internet (if such a thing is still possible) but maybe even some of that old utopianism it once promised. At its core, the computer and the Internet are tools for creation, education, commerce, play, and communication.</p></blockquote><p>Two takeaways here. First: AI was &#8220;prematurely&#8221; (from the perspective of the public) introduced to the public by profit-seeking firms, and it is in their interest that it widely proliferates to scrape every bit of data, erode privacy and copyright norms, and create dependents out of creatives and public institutions and other corporations as products are foisted upon each party. Second: digital systems and tools should not be ceded to the market&#8212;we should not accept the assumption driven into our heads that their natural form and function is to be an instrument of capital, profit, surveillance, social control, and so on. AI and the internet (as much as these terms can describe a singular thing) are constituted by actors whose interests don&#8217;t align with our own, and incidental scenarios where we both eek out a benefit tend to be slanted in the direction of those firms spreading the infection&#8212;not the public begging for a different implementation.</p><p>This reminds me of Ted Chaing's New Yorker essay "<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/will-ai-become-the-new-mckinsey">Will A.I. Become the New McKinsey" </a>which pegs the technology we call AI as broadly concerned with disempowering workers, extracting from the public, and consolidating power &amp; privilege:</p><blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not very convinced by claims that A.I. poses a danger to humanity because it might develop goals of its own and prevent us from turning it off. However, I do think that A.I. is dangerous inasmuch as it increases the power of capitalism. The doomsday scenario is not a manufacturing A.I. transforming the entire planet into paper clips, as one famous thought experiment has imagined. It&#8217;s A.I.-supercharged corporations destroying the environment and the working class in their pursuit of shareholder value. Capitalism is the machine that will do whatever it takes to prevent us from turning it off, and the most successful weapon in its arsenal has been its campaign to prevent us from considering any alternatives.</p></blockquote><p>Chaing's essay boils down to asking whether artificial intelligence will become another version of McKinsey, fondly described as "capital's willing executioners" by a former employee. You could make pro-social A.I. just as you could make pro-social McKinsey, but investors will either prioritize ventures that maximize shareholder value or figure out a way to hollow out and co-opt your alternative (as was done with ESG, which our financial sector promptly used to greenwash business as usual and attract even more investor activity).&nbsp;</p><p>Silicon Valley and artificial intelligence can/do lend themselves pretty easily to old and new eugenic projects, but they also lend themselves to other projects integral to capitalism as we know it: concentrating wealth, degrading working conditions, codifying extraction and dispossession, externalizing harm, and evading accountability. As Chaing points out, "technology has become conflated with capitalism, which has in turn become conflated with the very notion of progress." Criticism of capitalism, after all, means you oppose technology, progress, and the improvement of human civilization! Enriching a cloistered network of reactionaries more interested in scientific racism than eradicating poverty will do more to benefit humanity than, say, disempowering said phrenologists and tackling poverty, housing, climate change, and so on without solutions that run through Silicon Valley and its latest frontier of artificial intelligence hype.</p><p>The dynamic here is a simple one: we are told a foreign body will reinforce the resilience of the host body, but misled about who the host is. Various financiers and monopolistic firms, not the general public, stand to gain from the introduction and proliferation of automated systems and algorithmic oversight. </p><p>This is on full display with Marc Andreessen&#8217;s Techno-Optimist swill, but his <a href="https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/">&#8220;Why AI Will Save the World&#8221;</a> fits the mold here too. There, Andreessen argues that AI will "profoundly augment human intelligence" to improve every domain of human knowledge, raise our standard of living, and protect our way of life. AI will serve as a personalized tutor that helps children "maximize their potential with the machine version of infinite love." AI will be your "assistant/coach/mentor/trainer/advisor/therapist" with infinite patience, compassion, knowledge, and helpfulness. Every scientist, artist, engineer, entrepreneur, doctor, and caregiver will get an AI "assistant/collaborator/partner." It goes on and on like this:</p><blockquote><p>Perhaps the most underestimated quality of AI is how <em>humanizing </em>[sic] it can be. AI art gives people who otherwise lack technical skills the freedom to create and share their artistic ideas. Talking to an empathetic AI friend really does improve their ability to handle adversity. And AI medical chatbots are already more empathetic than their human counterparts. Rather than making the world harsher and more mechanistic, infinitely patient and sympathetic AI will make the world warmer and nicer.</p></blockquote><p>The other relevant part of this a16z specific manifesto is whereas homegrown AI might strengthen our society, foreign AI will destabilize it. "The single greatest risk of AI is that China wins global AI dominance," Andreessen writes&#8212;an outcome that can only be achieved, conveniently, if we avoid rules and regulations that might slow the pace of AI research and development (and the growth of the industry&#8217;s valuation).</p><p>This would be a scary picture if it was true. As Daron Acemo&#287;lu and Simon Johnson lay out in their recent book <em>Progress and Power</em>, the risk of destabilization is less a function of whether China or America develops the technology than the power relations dictating the financing, designing, and development of various technologies. "The broad-based prosperity of the past was not the result of any automatic, guaranteed gains of technological progress," the pair write. "We are the beneficiaries of progress, mainly because our predecessor made the progress work for more people." The book&#8212;a survey of the past 1,000 years of technological development&#8212;is unambiguously clear about this: major inventions don't have some inherent nature that tends towards improving life or enriching humanity. More often than not, they worsen life and deepen inequality because elites hoard their benefits and tightly dictate the terms of technological deployment. So when technological breakthroughs do yield positive outcomes, it's because those with power are FORCED into an agreement that distributes resources more equally. </p><p>AI boosters and zealots, even the venture capitalist lemmings among them, understand this&#8212;which is why it informs their desperate screeds valorizing a business model that boils down to printing out lottery tickets for friends then using the proceeds to subject various industries to shock therapy. Is it any surprise that billionaire investors insist any form of regulation or state intervention that threatens their ability to enrich and empower themselves (and their friends) is a &#8220;form of murder&#8221; while funding technologies that do actually kill people in hospitals, in police stops, at the border, and at large as their emissions intensify climate change? Of course not. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/ai-life-engineering-and-digital-hygiene/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/ai-life-engineering-and-digital-hygiene/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p>]]>

				<![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone!</p><p>Some programming notes first: I had initially planned for my first post to be the first in a series of columns about venture capital. It's taking a wee bit longer than expected, so we'll start with a roundup&#8212;stuff I&#8217;m interested in and want to comment on or quote at length. Additionally, we&#8217;ve got some recommendations of content I thought you all might enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>Roundups will typically be for paying subscribers but are free for everyone for the next month (starting today). These posts will run much longer than typical because they&#8217;re really multiple blogs/comments/pieces strung together. This one is somewhere north of 6,000 words, so I&#8217;ll quickly add a table of contents to make navigating it a bit easier.</p><p>Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got on our plate for this week&#8217;s roundup:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/i/97569871/crypto">Is Gary Gensler up to the task of regulating crypto?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/i/97569871/ai-art">A weird (and bad) defense of generative AI that centers markets and efficiency</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/i/97569871/gig-economy">Europe is on the verge of passing legislation that would improve labor conditions for workers on digital platforms</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/i/97569871/china">How China&#8217;s tech ecosystem is a mirror that lets us ignore America&#8217;s dysfunctional tech ecosystem</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/i/97569871/recommendations">Some books, movies, and music I&#8217;ve been enjoying</a></p></li></ul><p>If you enjoy this newsletter and want to keep reading more of this, please subscribe to The Tech Bubble. If you're already subscribed, many thanks and blessings to you.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Let&#8217;s get into it!</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Crypto</strong></h1><p>Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has been in the news a lot over the past few months as the foam of crypto bubbles begins to pop and his agency has announced fines, investigations, probes, and charges.&nbsp;</p><p>On November 21, we were treated to two reports from the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/21/technology/gary-gensler-crypto-sec.html">New York Times</a></em> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/21/gary-gensler-sec-cryptocurrency-wall-street-00062642">Politico</a>: the first a flattering profile painting Gensler as the "nemesis" of the crypto industry eager to apply laws on the books; the second a report that surveyed hostility to his "ambitious regulatory agenda poised to shake up much of corporate America." Both profiles are pretty entertaining in that you&#8217;re encouraged to judge Gensler by his enemies: whiny executives, crypto advocates, and even some politicians who seem pretty upset that an MIT professor and federal regulator won&#8217;t go easy on an industry rife with fraud, speculation, and vaporware.&nbsp;</p><p>(My favorite quote comes from Jeremy Kauffman, a CEO who sued the SEC in 2021: &#8220;I was hopeful that an M.I.T. professor who had studied cryptocurrency would have some semblance of fairness about him and not be a complete sociopath&#8221;)</p><p>All of this is nice and well but <em>is </em>Gensler the driven, competent, dogged crypto regulator these and other profiles are suggesting?&nbsp;</p><p>Amid the cycle of praise for Gensler, there was a December piece by Jeff John Roberts, Fortune's crypto editor, <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/12/14/gary-genslers-pr-stunts-cant-hide-how-he-botched-crypto-regulation/">arguing</a> that Gensler was using PR stunts to distract from a failure to properly regulate crypto.&nbsp;</p><p>Gensler may have sent out a statement to journalists detailing fraud charges against FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried after his company revealed it had mishandled billions of dollars worth of customer funds and then shortly thereafter declared bankruptcy but, Roberts asks, if it was a fraudulent operation going back years as the SEC statement maintains then why didn&#8217;t Gensler do anything about it? And why send the statement out at 2 AM ET on the day that the Justice Department was also set to announce charges against Bankman-Fried?</p><p>And if Gensler was the mortal enemy of crypto, as the profiles suggest, then where was he when the Terra ecosystem collapsed or when crypto lenders Voyager, Celsius, and BlockFi began to disintegrate? These are all fair questions from Roberts, but he&#8217;s not the first (and surely won&#8217;t be the last to raise them).</p><p>Back in 2021, Francine McKenna wrote a comprehensive takedown of Gensler in her Substack newsletter, <em>The Dig</em>, titled <a href="https://thedig.substack.com/p/gary-gensler-is-not-the-guy">"Gary Gensler is not the guy"</a> which argued just a month into his new job that he wouldn't be up to the task. Gensler earned a lot of praise for his track record on regulating derivatives at the CFTC but there was plenty of criticism he garnered at the time of his nomination to chair the regulatory agency over his time as a Clinton Treasury.</p><p>After retiring from Goldman Sachs at 39, Gensler took a job at Treasury and helped work on CFMA, a bill which The American Prospect wrote: "allowed the derivatives market to metastasize into a hotbed of financial risk with an estimated value -- before last fall's financial crash -- exceeding the world's real financial holdings."</p><p>But wait, there&#8217;s more:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;Derivatives are essentially contracts based on changes in the value of any asset, whether real (the price of soybeans) or more theoretical (the possible future losses any company suffers). Some derivatives are traded on regulated exchanges, but the CFMA gave the government's blessing to the so-called "over-the-counter" derivatives market, where handshake deals fly back and forth between financial parties with little or no regulatory oversight.&nbsp;</p><p>Gensler remained close to Wall Street players even after leaving the public sphere in 2000. He is a longtime investor in New Mountain Capital, a private buyout firm that paid him $70,000 last year in exchange for service on its advisory board. New Mountain, whose chief executive officer, Steven Klinsky, co-hosted a $28,500-per-head fundraiser for John McCain last year, even placed Gensler on the board of Strayer Education after taking it over eight years ago.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>Gensler <a href="https://prospect.org/article/problem-gary-gensler/">offered a mea culpa</a> and was successfully nominated, but still wrong-headed about how to proceed with derivatives. Gensler anticipated that Dodd-Frank was sufficient to reign in derivatives, for example, but big banks simply <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-swaps/">hid billions of dollars worth of trades</a> from Gensler&#8217;s CFTC.</p><p>One of McKenna's instructive examples, though, is MF Global, its bankruptcy, and what Gensler did (and didn&#8217;t do)&#8212;she&#8217;s <a href="https://thedig.substack.com/p/vaporized-the-halloween-horror-story">written</a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francinemckenna/2012/03/28/the-story-behind-todays-mf-global-congressional-testimony/?sh=67b30063a5a3">about it</a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francinemckenna/2011/11/09/mf-global-assets-have-left-the-building-how-when-where/?sh=43e1045b69eb">elsewhere</a> and is, by her admission, obsessed with it because it was a particularly egregious example of fraud that was gotten away with.&nbsp;</p><p>MF Global was a financial derivatives broker (sound familiar?) that sought to become as integral to financial services as Goldman Sachs (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c8ffb228-1dbe-4e8a-b30b-be7203d71e7d">sound familiar??</a>). They filed for bankruptcy on October 31, 2011, shortly after &#8220;discovering&#8221; $1.6 billion was missing from customer accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>MF Global's troubles first manifested in 2007 during a bear market that gave way to the Great Recession (sound familiar???) but seemed poised to turn things around after hiring Jon Corzine (former Goldman Sachs chairman, former U.S. Senator, and New Jersey governor) to be chairman and chief executive.</p><p>Corzine decided to try and shore up MF Global's books with a risky trading strategy&#8212;gambling that distressed bonds issued by Belgium, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, and Spain during Europe&#8217;s 2010 debt crisis could be bought at a steep discount and then redeemed at full value in a year. BUT (and this is a big one), that's a year or two without profits and that's a year or two where MF Global's financial performance could adversely affect the value of these bonds. In need of liquidity, MF Global did what any responsible financial actor would do: gambling (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftx-tapped-into-customer-accounts-to-fund-risky-bets-setting-up-its-downfall-11668093732">sound familiar????</a>).</p><p>So, MF Global entered into <a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/money-management/the-repo-maturity-game">repurchase-to-maturity agreements</a> that allowed it to sell the bonds at a discount from their value, but then agree to repurchase them at a later point for a certain price. If for some reason, the collateral grew even more worthless or the creditworthiness of the borrower declined then there would be a margin call&#8212;a cash payment in this case.&nbsp;</p><p>These repo agreements also had a few other attractive benefits for the firm: the junk debt wouldn't appear on MF Global's accounting books because it could technically claim the repo represented a sale, important in case the debt crisis got worse (which it did). Furthermore, if the interest on the bond was greater than the discount paid out to the lender via a cash payment, MF Global could record a profit (even though the debt wasn't on the books). And so, over the next year, MF Global's repo-to-maturity agreements ballooned to $7.4 billion and accounted for about 1/7 of its assets.</p><p>Well, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f07a6592-4ecc-3317-a6eb-167a9a1fc49a">guess what happened next reader</a>: the debt crisis continued to get worse, reducing the value of the collateral. This led to a growing number of margin calls against MF Global and credit rating downgrades&#8212;remember, MF Global entered into these agreements precisely because it was starved of liquidity!</p><p>Subsequent credit downgrades triggered successive waves of margin calls, leading ultimately to the last week of October when it experienced a run on the bank and customers withdrew over $100 billion from their accounts (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/crypto-exchange-ftx-saw-6-bln-withdrawals-72-hours-ceo-message-staff-2022-11-08/">sound familiar?????</a>). Despite all this, in its final days, MF Global was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mfglobal-stress/mf-global-was-confident-it-could-survive-idUKTRE7BC2GA20111213">convinced it could survive</a> certain financial ruin (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/technology/ftx-crypto-exchange.html">sound familiar??????</a>).</p><p>In the final days, MF Global was withdrawing cash from segregated customer accounts, using their funds to trade or make cash payments, and scrambling to return the money before end-of-day balances were reported to regulators. On October 28, MF Global "discovered" it was $300 million short of customer funds. On October 31, the number had grown to $900 million for customers of U.S. exchanges and another $700 million for customers of foreign exchanges (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/exclusive-least-1-billion-client-funds-missing-failed-crypto-firm-ftx-sources-2022-11-12/#:~:text=The%20exchange's%20founder%20Sam%20Bankman,amount%20at%20about%20%241.7%20billion.">sound familiar??????</a>). And so, left with no way out, MF Global filed for bankruptcy on Halloween.</p><p>In case it wasn&#8217;t clear by now, this sounds like what happened at FTX. It makes sense to ask, then, what did Gensler do when MF Global collapsed. Well, the chairman of the CFTC recused himself from the investigation into what happened because he and Corzine were close friends when they both worked at Goldman Sachs. Here&#8217;s McKenna on that:</p><blockquote><p>&#8221;Basically, Gensler bailed. The captain left the ship before the passengers were all safe. Maybe it was a &#8220;damned if he did, damned if he didn&#8217;t&#8221; situation. But it would have been arguably a lot better for the MF Global customers if he stayed, but then he would have had to avoid taking a call from Corzine about delaying the rules for how MF Global could use customer segregated funds the summer before.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>But that's not all Gensler did. He took the moment to kill a long-inactive proposal and then passed another to limit the types of financial instruments that firms like MF Global could use to invest customer funds. McKenna points to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, which wrote <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204903804577080480063317856">a pretty furious response</a> to the development: "This bureaucratic eyewash is not going to satisfy MF Global clients who have had their funds frozen, if not plundered. The CFTC chairman sought and received vast powers under the Dodd-Frank law on the premise that he and his staff had the wisdom and knowledge to re-engineer derivatives trading. CFTC regulators have now failed at a much less complicated task, and one of central importance to customers.&#8221;</p><p>All of this is important for a few reasons. The first and foremost is, again, MF Global sounds like FTX&#8212;Gensler fell asleep at the wheel the first time and is showing signs of life the second time around, but in ways that feel like PR stunts, as established by Roberts in Fortune. The second is that one of the major problems with the lead-up to and aftermath of MF Global is that Gensler&#8217;s philosophy for regulating markets seems woefully insufficient. In all of the aforementioned profiles, Gensler insists on simply enforcing the laws on the books against crypto instead of creating a new regulatory framework. Those aren&#8217;t encouraging words given it&#8217;s the existing laws that have given crypto operations the ability to grow into operations that are allegedly engaged in multi-billion frauds.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s no surprise, then, that McKenna got into a bit of a fight on Twitter last month over Gensler&#8217;s approach as FTX collapsed and the glowing praise began to surface. On December 26, she turned those arguments into a much longer piece that aimed at Gensler&#8217;s glowing profiles and other coverage painting him as the hero in a post titled <a href="https://thedig.substack.com/p/did-the-secs-gary-gensler-really">&#8220;Did the SEC's Gary Gensler really get crypto regulation right? I am not so sure.&#8221;</a></p><p>The core target here is a report released by a report from the American Economic Liberties Project, co-authored by antitrust scholar and AELP research director Matt Stoller titled <a href="https://www.economicliberties.us/our-work/gary-gensler-got-it-right/">&#8220;Gary Gensler Got It Right&#8221;</a></p><p>McKenna's rebuttal is long, comprehensive, and paywalled so I'll just highlight some of her key points here (but encourage you to go and subscribe to read it in full):</p><ol><li><p>The emergence and acceptance of cryptocurrency don&#8217;t only indict American financial and political thinking, as the AELP report suggests, but also regulators who have refused to act unless to pursue ineffective enforcement, attend lunches and dinners with crypto executives, and create a "roadway" that protects big crypto investors instead of retail investors.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>There&#8217;s been a selective focus on the revolving door between crypto and regulators that overlooks just how many people left Gensler's CFTC to join the industry&#8212;or how many regulators at Gensler's CFTC were party to lobbying done on behalf of firms like FTX.</p></li><li><p>Crypto proponents are not the only ones to criticize Gensler and the SEC. Former SEC officials, industry experts, lawyers, and so on are also concerned the SEC is not doing enough to ensure the contagion from FTX's collapse doesn't spread to the real economy, as well as calling attention to how FTX and the company were able to scale up by cultivating close relationships with regulators and financial institutions. The path to legitimacy for a crypto exchange ran through Gensler's SEC, which obliged Coinbase and FTX. Both entered into negotiations to gain SEC approval to trade digital assets, despite allegations that FTX was a fraud from the start.</p></li></ol><p>The Gensler debate is a proxy for what should be done about crypto. Should we simply enforce laws on the books and legitimize the trading of crypto assets and the creation of a legitimate crypto financial industry? Or should we kneecap this thing while we still can? I lean towards the latter: we can and should euthanize the rentiers and parasites and speculators before we go about trying to build anything with blockchain technology. As far as I can tell, there is nothing there except the potential to earn greater returns from gambling with other people&#8217;s money. At this point, most of the crypto assets hailed as savvy innovations have proven to be duds fueled by hype, inflated valuations, labor exploitation, and speculation.&nbsp;</p><p>It will not be a great tragedy if, for a few years, we deprive ourselves of the &#8220;financial innovations&#8221; that crypto advocates insist are just around the corner while we try to figure out a robust regulatory regime that protects consumers and minimizes systemic risk. Alternatively, we could keep deluding ourselves into thinking the current laws are sufficient (as Gensler seems to), and ensure more retail (consumer) and institutional investors (pensions, endowments, etc.) continue to lose their money to crypto fraud, theft, and speculation.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>AI Art</strong></h1><p>One of my favorite projects last year was an annotated version of NYT columnist Kevin Roose&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/annotations/latecomers-guide-to-crypto">"The Latecomer's Guide to Crypto"</a> that sought to correct what amounted to be "a thinly-veiled advertisement for cryptocurrency that appeared to have received little in the way of fact-checking or critical editorial scrutiny." It was a pretty clear, persuasive, and effective rebuttal of many key points and narratives invoked by Roose that was threatening to be uncritically repeated and adopted en masse. So imagine my surprise when someone shared with me a project (<a href="http://www.stablediffusionfrivolous.com/">&#8220;Stable Diffusion Frivolous&#8221;</a>) following the same angle, but in defense of what promises to be one of this year&#8217;s hype tech products: &#8220;AI art.&#8221;</p><p>Some background: On January 13, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Stability AI and MidJourney, along with art platform DeviantArt for their use of Stable Diffusion.&nbsp;</p><p>Stability AI and MidJourney style themselves as AI art generators, meaning they use Stable Diffusion to take pre-existing creative work, use those works as training data for neural networks, and generate derivatives. In this lawsuit, it's alleged some five billion images were taken without the artist's consent and essentially remixed, amounting to a massive violation of copyright law for millions of artists.</p><p>"At minimum, Stable Diffusion&#8217;s ability to flood the market with an essentially unlimited number of infringing images will inflict permanent damage on the market for art and artists," the lawsuit announcement reads.</p><p>The annotations themselves aren't particularly interesting or well-argued, obsessing over technical details instead of fundamental questions. Consider the invocation of Jevon's paradox, an economic observation that when the efficiency of a resource's consumption is increased, its demand will increase. The annotations look at aluminum&#8212;once a precious metal that Napoleon used for silverware and the Washington Monument used as a luxurious capstone, but now is ubiquitous because it costs $2/kg.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>AI art tools increase efficiency, yes. Contrary to myth, they rarely produce professional-quality outputs in one step, but combined into a workflow with a human artist they yield professional results in much less time than manual work. But that does not inherently mean a corresponding decrease in the size of the market, because as prices to complete projects drop due to the decreased time required, more people will pay for projects that they otherwise could not have afforded. Custom graphics for a car or building. An indie video game. A Mural for one's living room. All across the market, new sectors will be priced into the market that were previously priced out.</p></blockquote><p>There are two things to address here. First: the economics rant is not relevant to the lawsuit, which is asking whether you are violating copyright law when you use unlicensed images as training data for AI art tools. Most of the annotations work like this, pursuing tangents or quibbling on points that are ultimately concerned with markets and efficiency, not the <strong>legal question</strong>. Opponents are dismissed as &#8220;whittlers mad at power tools&#8221; and complaints are fielded that a system that did ask for consent would be technically difficult to build.</p><p>Second: it is not immediately clear why expanding art markets and increasing artist productivity is a desirable path forward. This was, after all, more or less the core thrust of many pro-NFT arguments over the past two years: sure, NFTs won&#8217;t help you make more art but they will allow you to do more with your art&#8212;speculation, secondary markets to trade fractional shares, experiences, targeted benefits, social clubs, etc. Individually creating all of those things would be tedious and cumbersome, but simply throwing your art onto the blockchain could outsource some of that work to zealous fans and communities would create more markets, more revenue streams, and more opportunities for additional art to be created by yourself or them.&nbsp;</p><p>NFTs, however, quickly proved <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgdvnd/the-nft-ecosystem-is-a-complete-disaster">themselves to be a disaster</a>. They created markets rife with fraud, outright theft, half-baked ideas and implementation, vaporware, and creative attempts to generate excess returns through speculation. There is a tendency to insist AI and crypto will help all artists, but experience suggests that recklessly rolling out these digital technologies to develop new markets tends to largely benefit con artists.</p><p>There is also a third point, a secret point, which is both and neither of the previous. Why is anyone pretending that what these AIs are creating is art? The other day, someone sent Nick Cave lyrics generated by ChatGPT in the style of his music and he wrote <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/chat-gpt-what-do-you-think/">a furious blog post</a> that was incredibly perceptive when it came to the question of what art is and why AI isn&#8217;t doing it.</p><blockquote><p>Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don&#8217;t feel. Data doesn&#8217;t suffer. ChatGPT has no inner being, it has been nowhere, it has endured nothing, it has not had the audacity to reach beyond its limitations, and hence it doesn&#8217;t have the capacity for a shared transcendent experience, as it has no limitations from which to transcend. ChatGPT&#8217;s melancholy role is that it is destined to imitate and can never have an authentic human experience, no matter how devalued and inconsequential the human experience may in time become.</p></blockquote><p>The core reason to object to AI art isn&#8217;t simply the legal question of licensing or the debates over how artists should make a living, but the fact that this is another front in the war waged by market zealots on life experienced outside of markets. In a bid to quantify the value of everything so that it can then be turned into an asset, its transaction costs made transparent, its production optimized, and its innovation ensured, market fundamentalists have created caricatures of how human minds, social networks, and communities are formed. They&#8217;re not interested in creativity, let alone any sublime element of what it means to be a human being&#8213;unless it can be linked back to a market. That&#8217;s a pretty depressing and increasingly dominant viewpoint of the world which shouldn&#8217;t be given any room to breathe.</p><p>So at the end of it all, this is an interesting document to read if only because it teases the shape of arguments to come as techno-optimists, venture capitalists, and market zealots reposition themselves to insist AI art is a net good. Advocates will avoid the central legal question (should you get paid for your work being used by a neural network to make similar work), and insist on reframing artists as workers who must produce more for less instead of creatives who should be provided a livelihood independent of demand for their work and spin new markets for speculation and commodification as opportunities for more ambitious artistic endeavors.&nbsp;</p><p>What I would love to see is an annotation of the lawsuit, though I doubt that will be coming as it would require a little work and the already shaky arguments would likely fall apart when forced to engage with the <strong>legal question</strong> and not rhetoric about the virtue of turning everything into a quantifiable transaction, digital commodity, or frictionless market.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Gig Economy</strong></h1><p>The European Union is on the brink of passing the Platform Work Directive, a proposal for a series of wage and labor protections for workers on digital labor platforms. This would be an important victory in the fight against worker misclassification and labor exploitation that powers most digital platforms&#8212;but first, let&#8217;s talk about what it is and how we got here.</p><p>Back in December 2021, the European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6605">announced</a> the proposal and detailed three key areas it would focus on to improve conditions for platform workers:</p><ul><li><p>Employment status: The PWD would establish criteria to determine whether a platform was an employer. Meeting two of those would legally qualify it as an employer and its workers as employees, granting them the right to "a minimum wage (where it exists, collective bargaining, working time and health protection, the right to paid leave or improved access to protection against work accidents, unemployment and sickness benefits, as well as contributory old-age pensions."</p></li><li><p>Algorithmic management: Digital platforms typically handle their misclassified workers through algorithmic overseers whose decisions are otherwise inscrutable. The PWD would require transparency about when, where, and how these algorithmic overseers are used along with "human monitoring" and the right to contest automated decisions. This will apply to employees and genuinely self-employed workers.</p></li><li><p>Enforcement, transparency, and traceability: Digital platforms enjoy information asymmetries that allow them to tightly control data generated by their platforms and their workers. Things are further complicated by their operation in multiple jurisdictions and states across the European Union, allowing digital platforms to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ser/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ser/mwac038/6726420#374667658">act as private regulators</a> that exploit differences in national laws while insisting that their cross-national operations exempt them from national regulatory frameworks. The PWD would clarify obligations platforms have to report what platform work is happening in what member state and by whom, lowering some barriers to data access and making it easier for a &#8220;cross-board regulatory approach.&#8221;</p></li></ul><p>That directive was the work of years of organizing inside and outside of Europe's political institutions. Inside the European Parliament, Leila Chaibi&#8212;a French Insoumise representative in the European Parliament, a member of the Left group, and <a href="https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/news/article/leila-chaibi-platform-workers-rights">a former gig worker herself</a>&#8212;quickly became one of the fiercest advocates for gig worker right and helped spearhead the campaign to draft (and now pass) the directive. She has <a href="https://jacobin.com/2022/12/platform-employees-european-parliament-leila-chaibi-workers-rights">a pretty interesting and wide-ranging interview</a> in <em>Jacobin</em> about labor rights, the directive, political coalitions in the European Parliament, French politics, and macroeconomic conditions worth checking out, here is a snippet:</p><blockquote><p>We managed to build a broad coalition for this. Why? Because even the traditional right &#8212; while loving things like the market and competition &#8212; could not accept that some companies had to comply with the law and others [the platforms] did not. Being in favor of fair competition, it could not accept the way platforms do things. So, we as a Parliament managed to get a very ambitious proposal from the European Commission. We managed to bring the workers themselves to the institutions in Brussels, to make the Commission &#8212; used to always listening to the lobbies, to the platforms &#8212; listen to them. If you have someone in front of you all day, of course you will be influenced.</p></blockquote><p>This is a pretty exciting development! It still has to pass a vote to outright become law or be opened to amendments that would water it down (that vote was scheduled for January 19th but delayed to the 30th because of ongoing strikes). Still, these sorts of protections are important reforms not just because they improve the lives of people engaged in precarious work, but because they also destabilize foundational arrangements that make the gig economy possible.&nbsp;</p><p>The gig economy without these reforms is a fundamentally unprofitable industry that relies on regulatory arbitrage, labor exploitation, piles of venture capital funding, propaganda, and outright lies to chug along; substantially increasing labor costs creates an opening for it to disintegrate and be replaced by something else which still provides good wages and labor conditions BUT ALSO a model that expands our public goods and services instead of competing with and degrading and privatizing them.</p><p>On that point, Robert Hockett wrote a great piece in Forbes titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhockett/2023/01/15/why-is-uber-ber-alles--public-platform-infrastructure-for-the-gig-economy/?sh=2bbef8c745b6">Why Is Uber &#220;ber Alles? Public Platform Infrastructure for the &#8216;Gig Economy.&#8217;&#8221;</a> Hockett's article hits on something I've been yelling about for a while: digital platforms are using <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5q49x/grubhubs-disastrous-free-lunch-promotion-shows-why-the-gig-economy-is-broken">infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkgv79/social-media-is-dead">resources</a> that would be better suited in public, not private, hands.</p><blockquote><p>Two needs of cardinal interest to all major metropolitan areas, if not indeed all towns and cities, seem to go under-appreciated these days: First, the need for readily available livery and delivery services, which have amounted to a species of essential infrastructure since the earliest days of our republic. And second, the need of a decent quality of life for local residents who provide such services, which amounts among other things to a prerequisite to the sustainability of any means of satisfying the first need. A city like New York, for example, benefits immensely from, and could hardly get on without, readily available and affordable livery for persons and delivery of things (letters, documents, medicines, groceries, meals, etc.), hence also from arrangements that sustainably attract and retain local providers of such services. That&#8217;s why you see taxis, buses, small trucks and other delivery vehicles everywhere, and indeed always have.</p></blockquote><p>The current ride-hail system in New York City makes little sense as Roberts explains: Uber drivers on average earn 52 percent of each fare, 25-43 percent go to Uber and the remaining 15 percent to New York. Uber offers a "two-sided marketplace" while New York is supposed to ensure safety. Riders face growing price hikes and wait times that fall heaviest on non-white users, drivers face perpetual wage cuts, and labor conditions continue to degrade to the point that strings of suicides are regular as drivers push their bodies and minds to a breaking point.&nbsp;</p><p>Hockett argues that cities should establish their public platforms, continue to take a 15 percent cut, and give the rest to drivers. Such a system could give drivers the labor rights that have eluded them in the United States and protect their physical and mental health as well:</p><blockquote><p>All that Uber and Lyft are &#8216;efficient&#8217; at now that a city would not be is gratuitously extracting high fees from riders and profits from drivers. They add no value in return for these forms of extraction that cities couldn&#8217;t provide just as well on a not-for-profit basis, again given <a href="https://reasonstreet.co/business-model-two-sided-marketplace/">how old, familiar, and inexpensive the matching-technology</a> used by their algorithms are.</p></blockquote><p>The main problem that emerges from any proposal of a public option tends to be: who will do the computing? Digital platforms own all the data, algorithms, and technical know-how that ensures their operation and often use computational infrastructure like data centers or servers held by other Big Tech firms or real estate investment trusts. I think we should simply seize all of this and operate it publicly, but that&#8217;s for another post.&nbsp;</p><p>Hockett's argument here is sufficient and a good one to consider now that Europe is adopting reforms that will make drivers' lives better and make plain how unstable and unsustainable the gig economy is. What comes after it? We need to intentionally design platforms and technologies that meet social needs and abide by labor laws and don't give rise to firms that can translate venture capital subsidies into private political and regulatory power.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Start with our cities, then move up higher and higher to our state and federal governments, making them truly the servants of all rather than recognizing Silicon Valley firms as masters of us all.</p></blockquote><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>China</strong></h1><p>Tech Won&#8217;t Save Us (subscribe to them if you haven&#8217;t already) just had <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/what-the-us-china-divide-means-for-tech-w-louise-matsakis/id1507621076?i=1000593913797">a great conversation</a> with Louise Matsakis&#8212;a tech reporter at Semafor&#8212;about the growing US-China divide rift and what increasingly aggressive rhetoric and policy mean for the tech industry.&nbsp;</p><p>The conversation is kicked off by an article she <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/01/04/2023/the-youtubers-going-viral-by-predicting-chinas-collapse">wrote</a> early this month on a genre of Youtube video that constantly insists China is on the verge of total collapse and serves as a smart way to survey fears and anxieties about China&#8217;s place in the global order.</p><p>So, most of these people are themselves just trying to get views&#8212;except outright anti-CCP groups&#8212;but they are finding traction because China&#8217;s borders are closed, information is a bit harder to come by without putting in some work, and this information vacuum is happening at the same time as China finds itself facing genuine challenges (economic slowdown, population decline, zero-Covid policy, human rights abuses, etc.).</p><p>From her interview:</p><blockquote><p>This narrative about the East collapsing or being on the verge of destruction or taking over the world is so alluring and has been for a really long time. Something I really like to do is look back at mainstream magazine covers from the 80s. I&#8217;ll never forget&#8212;it&#8217;s seared into my brain&#8212;when we were so terrified of Japan in the 80s there was an incredibly racist Atlantic cover of a sumo wrestler next to the world and the headline is &#8220;Containing Japan&#8221; and this big sumo wrestler who is as big as the rest of the world. That narrative hasn&#8217;t gone away.</p></blockquote><p>The draw here is that simplistic narratives about China&#8212;sometimes racist, sometimes paranoid&#8212;are easier to digest than our incredibly complex reality. In the 80s, fear of Japanese competition for market share of the semiconductor industry led to a flurry of failed policies aimed at bringing that supply chain back under American control. Fear-mongering about China, then, can provide cover for certain policies or spur action in certain industries, or cobble together support for certain geopolitical objectives more easily than pitching collaboration with China, honestly engaging the public, or trying to rally politicians or corporations.</p><p>One easy example here is TikTok. Over the past few years, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of alarm bells go off about the social media app: Niall Ferguson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-08-09/tiktok-is-the-superweapon-in-china-s-cultural-warfare">argued</a> that it was &#8220;digital fentanyl&#8221; and &#8220;revenge for the Chinese century of humiliation&#8221; in one Bloomberg column, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-politics-united-states-government-china-privacy-26b0ee0d4c8421fa7f58b06f76651dc1#:~:text=MADISON%2C%20Wis.,Indiana%2C%20Louisiana%20and%20South%20Dakota.">state governments</a> and <a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/us-government-banned-tiktok-federal-devices-whats-next">Congress</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/15/business/auburn-tiktok-ban-students.html">universities</a> have banned it from devices they own, and bills have been put forward to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/lawmakers-unveil-bipartisan-bill-that-aims-to-ban-tiktok-in-the-us.html">outright ban</a> TikTok from the United States.</p><p>The other easy example here boils down to the global tech supply chain. Concerns that Chinese tech would have secret government backdoors sparked the Trump administration&#8217;s <a href="https://2017-2021.state.gov/the-clean-network/index.html">&#8220;clean networks&#8221;</a> initiative to stop America and its allies from using Chinese tech in various sectors. Fear that China could weaponize dependence on its semiconductor manufacturing has led to a flurry of bills and moves to subsidize <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-free-trade-case-against-subsidies-and-tariffs-changes-when-china-is-involved-11658925419">domestic semiconductor manufacturing</a> and compete on <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/choking-chinas-access-future-ai">artificial intelligence research</a>.</p><p>But clinging to the relatively superficial narratives about a war with China, imminent collapse, or fear-mongering about weaponization or government backdoors misses pretty interesting developments at every level.</p><p>We might overlook that ByteDance, which owns TikTok, is a darling of venture capital and has received <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/vc-s-8-billion-bytedance-headache">nearly $8 billion</a> from investors since Sequoia Capital's China arm first invested in 2014. Or that it has grown its <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2022&amp;id=D000073174">lobbying effort</a> from a meager 17 lobbyists and $270,000 in 2019 to 47 lobbyists and $2.6 million in 2020. Since then, lobbyists have stayed steady but expenditures have ticked up to $5.1 million in 2021 and $4.2 million in 2022 (excluding Q4, which hasn&#8217;t ended yet).&nbsp;</p><p>Venture capital has no qualms with where their money comes from or goes to so long as it makes them more money&#8212;as is the case with lobbying&#8212;so one takeaway might be that we should reign in those two arenas if we are interested in limiting the ability of tech firms to draw in billions and convert those VC subsidies into political power. Or we can just insist this is an issue specific to Chinese firms.</p><p>Other developments such as China's <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58625934">moves to restrict usage</a> of its domestic version of TikTok to 40 minutes a day for children or its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-bytedance-says-has-reorganised-strategic-investment-team-2022-01-19/">cuts to &#8220;strategic investment&#8221; teams</a> amid China&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-14/meituan-bytedance-pledge-to-comply-with-renewed-antitrust-push">antitrust crackdown</a>, might also be worth considering as we try to struggle to institute antitrust reforms of our technology sector. The TikTok bans are stupid because they want to ban TikTok for being a Chinese app, but we should be restricting TikTok because it is an app and tech platforms enjoy far too much power in shaping our lives. At this juncture, however, such a realization seems beyond lawmakers&#8212;especially as Big Tech giants successfully attempt to spin themselves as nationalist champions <a href="https://futurehistories-international.com/episodes/s01/e42-moira-weigel-on-palantir-tech-nationalism-aggression-in-the-life-world/">Big Enough to compete with China</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, the saber-rattling with China on the question of semiconductors and &#8220;clean networks&#8221; may be presented as a very simple competition issue with China but it figures into a much more complex struggle over European, Chinese, and American attempts to create technology stacks impervious to geopolitics&#8212;only to realize their stacks will be limited by the geopolitical strategies they pursued over the past few decades that shaped policy priorities, productive capacities, supply chains, and economic partnerships.</p><p>Evgeny Morozov has written two great essays in <em>Le Monde</em> about the geopolitics of <a href="https://mondediplo.com/2021/08/03morozov">semiconductors</a> and <a href="https://mondediplo.com/2020/11/10huawei">Huawei</a>, a Chinese telecommunications giant integral to ICT technology stacks across the world. Both are worth reading in full and sketch out a picture that suggests that the stakes are much higher than commentary suggests because of their complexity&#8212;countries are concerned about technology sovereignty, but also concerned about supply shocks and off-shoring.</p><p>On semiconductor chips:</p><blockquote><p>The dialectic of the chip crisis would have delighted scholars of the Frankfurt School, if only for exposing the inner dumbness of today&#8217;s smart society. The scarcity of chips has forced us to wait for the latest consumer electronics: without semiconductors (some at only $1 a piece), they cannot function. All those electric cars, smartphones, smart fridges, and toothbrushes have suddenly disappeared into the black hole of global capitalism, as if an invisible spoilsport had cancelled the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas.&nbsp;</p><p>Today&#8217;s crisis isn&#8217;t exceptional. This time, however, it has come amidst wider anxiety about globalisation, the decline of western industrial activity, and politicisation of advanced technology such as AI, now a strategic domain in the US/China standoff. This explains how a boring technical issue, which ten years ago would have had little impact outside the directly affected industries, has become a massive headache for governments.</p></blockquote><p>On Huawei:</p><blockquote><p>Whatever happens to Huawei in the near future, China, Russia and other countries have received the message loud and clear: achieving technological sovereignty is imperative. China had grasped the importance of this even before Trump launched his attack, which only strengthened the sense of urgency. It would be ironic if the ultimate effect of the US&#8217;s war on Huawei was a much more technologically advanced and independent China, with a completely different supply chain that included no American companies. Paradoxically, it is Washington that has got Beijing to act upon one of Ren&#8217;s pithy sayings, that &#8216;without an independent national [tech] industry there can be no national independence.&#8217;</p></blockquote><p>All this to say that Matsakis is right: China is complex and a lot of how we talk about China and its tech ecosystem overlooks our tech sector in favor of half-heartedly pursuing a geostrategy that&#8217;s kneecapped by fear-mongering or a refusal to embark on serious political economic reforms necessary to achieve whatever it is &#8220;winning&#8221; looks like.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Recommendations</strong></h1><p><em>Playlist of the Week</em></p><p>I&#8217;m going to make themed playlists to accompany roundups (if you have suggestions for platforms besides Spotify, I&#8217;m all ears). This week is all about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5Rzb5EWnyn2V91nHUSMDBp?si=f7bd2467f8d947a2">posse cuts</a>. There&#8217;s some overrepresentation from some of my favorite rap (super)groups&#8212;Beast Coast and Black Hippy&#8212;but that's okay.</p><iframe class="spotify-wrap playlist" data-attrs="{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://mosaic.scdn.co/640/ab67616d0000b2732ae92030b51fb8135d694af9ab67616d0000b273986cd6b330f7405b17a604f4ab67616d0000b273eb112b7080ea65f681da71edab67616d0000b273fcd3724fba954e6104e4530d&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Crew Cuts&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;By Edward Ongweso Jr.&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Playlist&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5Rzb5EWnyn2V91nHUSMDBp&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;noScroll&quot;:false}" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5Rzb5EWnyn2V91nHUSMDBp" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen="true" allow="encrypted-media" loading="lazy" data-component-name="Spotify2ToDOM"></iframe><p><em>Listens of the Week</em></p><p>One song I have been replaying is &#8220;Fuck the Nordic Model&#8221; by Ghais Guevara off his album BlackBolshevik (great name). I&#8217;m obsessed with a lot of things going on here but specifically: the Chipmunk&#8217;d sample of Jamie Foxx&#8217;s live cover of Midnight Star&#8217;s Slow Jam, the slight flow shift in the second verse that makes each line fall over the next one, and the way that builds and explodes into to the verse&#8217;s end &#8220;<em>Opps steady thinkin' we cool/I&#8217;m just settin' you up for a murder like army recruiters.</em>&#8221; Not a special line but it sounds so nice to my ears.</p><p>This week&#8217;s album is Nobody Can Live Forever (The Existential Soul of Tim Maia), a great compilation of Maia&#8217;s best songs that introduced me to Brazilian music and a good bit of psychedelic funk. It's hard to choose a favorite but I used to play &#8220;Ela Partiu&#8221; and &#8220;Que Beleza&#8221; so much that my little brother's first words were lyrics from the songs that he&#8217;d sing along with me.</p><iframe class="spotify-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2733cbf8ddc75f26be53b67330d&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Fuck the Nordic Model&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;Ghais Guevara&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/5mlBpbsz2m7U3dooRrEbZU&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;noScroll&quot;:false}" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5mlBpbsz2m7U3dooRrEbZU" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen="true" allow="encrypted-media" loading="lazy" data-component-name="Spotify2ToDOM"></iframe><iframe class="spotify-wrap album" data-attrs="{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2733faf680c98eed3f0a6ecb61d&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;World Psychedelic Classics 4: Nobody Can Live Forever: The Existential Soul of Tim Maia&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;Tim Maia&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Album&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/0q41u8oMFT9Ewr2tqGnmL8&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;noScroll&quot;:false}" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0q41u8oMFT9Ewr2tqGnmL8" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen="true" allow="encrypted-media" loading="lazy" data-component-name="Spotify2ToDOM"></iframe><p><em>Books of the Week</em></p><p>I start each year reading LAST AND FIRST MEN/STAR MAKER, my two favorite science fiction books, and both from sci-fi grandmaster Olaf Stapledon. The first follows the next two billion years of human history and the sixteen species of humanity that follow us. The second follows the entire history of our universe, as life struggles to find meaning and eventually make contact with God.&nbsp;</p><p>I just finished reading ADELE: A NOVEL by Leila Slimani (a Parisian journalist with a sex addiction that threatens to ruin her life) and ALL SYSTEMS RED by Martha Wells (a security android programmed to kill gains sentience).&nbsp;Both are great books, ADELE inches out here because I recently watched SHAME and CRASH which have a similar self-possessed horny energy to them that&#8217;s fun to follow along.</p><p>Going to start rereading PALO ALTO by Malcolm Harris (an amazing history of the tech industry, California, America, and the global economy) and PIRATE ENLIGHTENMENT by David Graeber (a fun revisionist history focused on Madagascar pirates, their descendants, and the political/social experiments both embarked on), both forthcoming!</p><p><em>Films of the Week</em></p><p>Two films I think readers would enjoy are Koyaanisqatsi (1982) and Possessor (2020).&nbsp;</p><p>KOYAANISQATSI largely features visuals of cities and nature, along with some beautiful music from Phillip Glass. I haven't seen the trilogy yet but will try to check out the next two films (Powaqqatsi and Naqoyqatsi) this weekend. Letterboxd describes it as a "visual tone poem" that shows us "the heavy toll that modern technology is having on humans and the earth." That&#8217;s a bit of a vulgarization, but I think it&#8217;s best to just dive in here without much of an articulation of what it&#8217;s like.</p><p>POSSESSOR is a fascinating and gruesome body horror/science-fiction film directed by Brandon Cronenburg (David Cronenberg&#8217;s son) that takes place in a future where elite corporate assassins take control of people via implants to kill targets. We follow one assassin as her mind is starting to unravel ahead of One Last Job that goes awry.</p><p>You can stream or pirate both pretty easily, though if you're in NYC you can also watch the uncut version on January 25th at the Nitehawk Cinema (9:30 PM).</p><div><hr></div><p>And that&#8217;s it for this week&#8217;s roundup!
