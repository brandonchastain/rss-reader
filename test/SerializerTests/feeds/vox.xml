	President Donald Trump greets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on August 18, 2025. | Alex Wong/Getty Images	</figcaption></figure><p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story appeared in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-logoff-newsletter-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Logoff</a>, a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/logoff-newsletter-trump-administration-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subscribe here</a></em>.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Welcome to The Logoff:</strong> A short-notice meeting at the White House today brought President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and seven other European leaders together to discuss the Russian war in Ukraine — but revealed little about whether a peace deal will be possible.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What happened?</strong> Two major topics of discussion were the possibility of a ceasefire and security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump said the US would provide Ukraine with “very good protection” from Russia as part of a potential peace deal; though the specifics of such an arrangement are still unclear, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte described it as a “breakthrough.”&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">The other big result of the meeting is the promise of another meeting — this time, a trilateral discussion between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which Trump has pushed to arrange, and Zelenskyy today signaled he would be open to.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">The meeting also went more smoothly than Trump’s February conversation with Zelenskyy, which devolved into Trump and Vice President JD Vance both haranguing the Ukrainian leader.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who attended?</strong> The meeting featured a remarkable assemblage of European leaders who gathered to show support for Zelenskyy, underscoring the war’s broader significance to the continent. In addition to Trump and Zelenskyy, the leaders of Finland, France, Germany, Italy, and the UK were in the room, as were Rutte and Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the context?</strong> Today&#8217;s meeting follows Trump’s Friday summit with Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, which ended abruptly with little announced progress. Over the weekend, however, Trump indicated his support for a Putin plan that would require Ukraine to cede territory as a condition for ending the war, as well as backed off his previous insistence on an immediate ceasefire.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s next?</strong> A trilateral meeting between Trump, Putin, and Zelenskyy now seems more likely. Such a meeting could build on discussions over the past two weeks and bring Putin and Zelenskyy face-to-face — but it’s unclear whether Putin is even interested in ending a war when he believes his troops are still winning on the battlefield. </p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">And with that, it’s time to log off…</h2><p class="has-text-align-none">If you haven’t read the latest edition of Vox Book Club, I highly recommend it — my colleague Kelsi Trinidad rounded up a list of excellent book recommendations from the Vox staff, and you can read them all <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/457691/summer-reads-book-club-recommendations-ocean-vuong-kaveh-akbar">here</a>.

	MSNBC is now MS NOW. | Versant	</figcaption></figure><p class="has-text-align-none">Goodbye MSBNC, and hello “MS NOW.”</p><p class="has-text-align-none">In an announcement that has triggered widespread befuddlement and mockery, the progressive cable news network is getting rebranded.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">The new name isn’t meant to call to mind Microsoft or the honorific “Ms.” Instead, in the style of congressional bill-naming, MS NOW is purportedly an acronym for the following mouthful: “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760533/msnbc-my-source-news-opinion-world-rebrand">My Source for News, Opinion, and the World</a>.”</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Underneath this seemingly silly story, though, are currents of major change — and fear — in the mainstream media.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Because both MSNBC and its fellow political news network CNN are meeting the same fate; they’re being jettisoned by the big corporate behemoths that currently own them. </p><p class="has-text-align-none">Those corporate behemoths — Comcast owns MSNBC, while Warner Bros. owns CNN — have legitimate business reasons for making this change. Each is offloading these political news channels, as well as various other cable networks, to a new separate company, called by some a “SpinCo” (spin-off company) and by others a “ShitCo” (no explanation needed). This is because cable news is viewed as a declining business.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Yet there’s another clear implication. President Donald <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/business/msnbc-trump-comcast-cnbc">Trump loathes both MSNBC and CNN</a>, and his administration has been willing and eager to wage personal and political vendettas against their corporate owners.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Take, for instance, how <a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2025/paramount-makes-settlment-offer-trump-rejects/">Paramount had to grovel before Trump</a> because he was annoyed at Paramount-owned CBS. The Federal Communications Commission held up Paramount’s merger deal until the company agreed to pay a $16 million settlement in a <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/paramounts-trump-lawsuit-settlement-curtain-call-for-the-first-amendment">bogus lawsuit</a> Trump had brought against <em>60 Minutes.</em></p><p class="has-text-align-none">So now, with these spinoffs, Comcast and Warner Bros. will no longer have to worry about being punished by the federal government for MSNBC and CNN’s coverage.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear: Comcast’s spin-off of MSNBC and other cable properties <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/comcast-spin-off-cable-channels-streaming-partner-peacock-1236049904/">was already in the works</a> before Trump won his second term. And there’s obviously no political motivation behind Comcast ditching its other cable properties, like the USA Network, SYFY, Oxygen, the Golf Channel, CNBC, and E! (Comcast is keeping NBC News and Universal Studios.)</p><p class="has-text-align-none">But since Trump began his second term, the company’s thinking has apparently evolved on one point: whether MSNBC can keep its name.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Back in January, the new CEO of MSNBC’s SpinCo, Mark Lazarus, said that <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/msnbc-name-comcast-spinoff-1236256381/#:~:text=MSNBC%20will%20retain%20its%20name%20after%20it%20is%20spun%20off,along%20with%20other%20cable%20assets.">MSNBC would keep its name</a> after the spin-off. So the announcement Monday of the new MS NOW name was a change of plan.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">This would, of course, create more obvious distance between whatever “MS NOW” is up to and the existing NBC media empire.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">CNBC, in contrast, will get to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/media/msnbc-change-name-ms-now-spinoff-nbcuniversal-rcna225563">keep its name</a> despite being spun off. We don’t know whether that’s because they’re less likely to displease Trump, less likely to cause problems for NBC’s brand, or some other reason.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">What we do know is that, this year, Trump has normalized the weaponization of the government against corporations who have displeased him with shocking speed. For now, at least, this has to be part of companies’ strategic calculations. Placating the president is the new cost of doing business in the United States of America.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

	A bald eagle perched on a tree in Seward, Alaska. The state has the largest bald eagle population in the country. | Hasan Akbas/Anadolu via Getty Images	</figcaption></figure><p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration is worried, it would seem, about eagles — like, the big birds of prey with sharp talons and famously good eyesight.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this month, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who oversees endangered species, <a href="https://x.com/SecretaryBurgum/status/1952501870393786822/photo/1">wrote on X</a> that wind-energy projects kill eagles, including the iconic bald eagle, and his agency would work to protect them from harm.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">He even appended a memo to the post that directs the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which falls under Burgum’s command, to enforce an existing law called the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/law/bald-and-golden-eagle-protection-act">Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act</a> to make sure that these birds are not “sacrificed” for wind power. The law makes killing or harming eagles<strong></strong>without a government permit illegal.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">One possible interpretation is that Burgum simply cares about birds. Or the bald eagle, anyway, a national symbol.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">A more obvious one is that the Trump administration continues to do everything it can to shutter or stall the build-out of US wind farms — which Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/407981/wind-energy-iowa-trump-escape-velocity-energy-climate-progress">really seems to abhor</a>. That apparently includes suddenly caring about certain<strong></strong>wildlife regulations.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, wind turbines are, in fact, a serious threat to birds of prey, <a href="https://abcbirds.org/golden-eagles-wind-turbines/">including eagles</a>, and to <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/24048465/bats-endangered-climate-change">bats</a>, especially when they’re not built or operated with wildlife in mind. Accurate estimates are hard to come by, though it’s reasonable to assume that turbine blades kill <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2016/06/trumps-hot-air-on-wind-energy/">hundreds of eagles per year</a> nationwide. That number is somewhere around 1 million birds per year if you account for all avian species, <a href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/wind-power-bird-deaths">according to data scientist Hannah Ritchie</a>.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">That being said, a <em>much</em> bigger threat to birds is stray cats, buildings, and cars. Cats, alone, kill as many as <a href="https://abcbirds.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Loss_et_al._2013-Impacts_Outdoor_Cats.pdf">2.4 billion birds</a> per year nationwide. Yes, <em>billion</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">And another more serious threat than turbines? Climate change — the very problem that wind energy is helping fix. A <a href="https://www.audubon.org/climate/survivalbydegrees">landmark 2019 report</a> by the National Audubon Society, a nonprofit bird conservation group, found that rising temperatures put nearly two-thirds of North American bird species at an elevated risk of extinction, including golden eagles.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, there’s this: Although bald eagles were once on the brink of extinction, these birds are doing just fine now. Actually more than fine. Between 2009 and 2019, their population in the lower 48 states <a href="https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2020-bald-eagle-population-size-report.pdf">quadrupled</a> to more than 300,000 individuals, close to historic population estimates. That doesn’t include Alaska —&nbsp;home to the <a href="https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=baldeagle.main">largest bald eagle population in the US</a>&nbsp;— where <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/corey-arnold-aleutian-dreams/">some people consider them pests</a> because they’re so abundant.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Bald eagles don’t need saving from Trump officials.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">The many species that do, meanwhile, are losing protections because of policy decisions by those very same officials. So far, the Trump administration has moved to limit the scope of laws meant to safeguard <a href="https://www.publicdomain.media/p/trump-administration-incoherence-migratory-birds-wind" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.publicdomain.media/p/trump-administration-incoherence-migratory-birds-wind">migratory birds</a>, including eagles, and all <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/04/16/endangered-species-harm-habitat/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/04/16/endangered-species-harm-habitat/">federally endangered species</a>, seemingly to loosen restrictions on the oil and gas industry. Separately, in May, the administration took <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/413064/trump-endangered-species-act-lesser-prairie-chicken">steps to undo federal protections for the lesser prairie-chicken</a>, an imperiled ground bird in Texas that lives atop oil-rich lands.&nbsp;It’s also planning to open up eagle-filled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/climate/national-petroleum-reserve-alaska-trump-drilling.html">wilderness in Alaska</a> to drilling, <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/414626/ecosystems-mission-area-trump-cuts-wildlife-monitoring">cut funding</a> for a <a href="https://www.aba.org/proposed-bird-banding-lab-closure-endangers-bird-research/">bird-monitoring</a> program, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-expansion-of-american-timber-production/">log more US forests</a>, which are famously where birds live.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Ironically, it’s the policies and programs that Trump officials are now eroding that helped save bald eagles in the first place. So if the administration was serious about helping eagles — or the hundreds of other American bird species, from hummingbirds to owls — it’s pretty clear that its actions would look a lot different.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

	What makes everything different from before 2018 is the seamlessness. | Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images	</figcaption></figure><p class="has-text-align-none">Almost every tech platform is designed to grab your attention and never let it go. You give it clicks, and it gives you dopamine. Games, news updates, social media hits — they all run on the same logic. We can add a new activity to the list: gambling. In just a few years, sports betting has gone from a legal gray area to a mainstream multibillion-dollar industry.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">And this isn’t just about sports. It’s about how our economy increasingly exploits our cognitive biases and our irrationality, and how institutions — governments, media companies, even the sports leagues — have partnered in this system, because they all want a cut of the action.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Jonathan Cohen is the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Losing-Big-Americas-Reckless-Gambling/dp/B0DGS6G35H"><em>Losing Big: America’s Reckless Bet on Sports Gambling</em></a>. It’s a new book about the financial infrastructures that we’ve built on top of psychological vulnerabilities. I invited him onto <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about how this happened so fast, what online gambling shares with social media and crypto, and how destructive — on a human level — all of this has been.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">As always, there’s much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP9852766605&#038;light=true" width="100%"></iframe><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Tell me about the </strong><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-476_dbfi.pdf"><strong>2018 Supreme Court case</strong></a><strong> that opened the floodgates for sports gambling seemingly overnight.</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">In 1992, the sports leagues went to Congress because of a threat, that was real at the time, of states legalizing sports gambling. And Congress passed a law called the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-bill/474">Professional Amateur Sports Protection Act</a> that banned states from legalizing sports betting. And then, in 2018, the Supreme Court rendered PASPA, as it was called, unconstitutional on the grounds of basically states&#8217; rights. And so, starting in 2018 with the Supreme Court decision, states are allowed to legalize sports gambling if they so choose.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How many states have chosen to do it? And how quickly?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">Delaware did within six weeks. Today, as we&#8217;re talking in July of 2025, we have 38 states and Washington, DC, with legal sports gambling; 30 with online legal sports gambling; probably soon to be 39 and 31 later this year with <a href="https://www.kmbc.com/article/missouri-wagerizes-sports-wagering-close-vote/62832563">Missouri</a>.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>FanDuel and DraftKings are the names almost everyone knows. How much of the pie do they control?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">A lot. Those are the major players, almost to the point of a duopoly, defining the industry. And they have, I would say, around 80 percent, maybe 85 percent of market share. And of course it depends on some states. There are lots of other companies out there fighting for third, fourth, fifth place.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What happened to online gambling during the Covid era?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">It takes off politically in places like <a href="https://nysfocus.com/2025/01/16/what-is-sports-betting-new-york">New York</a> because of the fiscal crunch faced by states. And this isn’t a new thing. It goes back to the lottery, and even <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2025/03/17/march-19-1931-nevada-re-legalizes-gambling/82440517007/">during the Great Depression</a>, when slot machines were legalized in four states because they needed the revenue.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Lawmakers have this belief that there&#8217;s always more money in the gambling cookie jar. <em>Oh, we need money. Let&#8217;s just legalize more forms of gambling, and that will make up for our revenue shortfalls.</em> Politically, that&#8217;s exactly what happens during Covid in places like New York and in other states.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">But to your point about Covid, we have a lot of people sitting on their couches and a lot of professional sports are starting to come back. And lo and behold, there&#8217;s a new app on their phone where they can legally, seamlessly, frictionlessly gamble. So you can imagine the way the industry grows its market share and grows its foothold in that time.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The gambling companies promise the states all this easy revenue, and they go all in. How does that bet work out for them?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">This is what&#8217;s tough about gambling in general and sports betting in particular. In most cases, it actually has met expectations if you were the fiscally responsible person who is reading the budget projections. But the question is at what cost?&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Let’s talk about the cost, especially the human cost.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You open the book with this story about a young guy named Kyle whose life was completely ripped apart. Why did you start there? What does his story capture about these gambling apps and how they&#8217;re designed?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">I thought Kyle was emblematic of what’s happened here. He’s a 26-year-old white guy who ran into trouble gambling on sports, but then even more specifically because he was someone who had gambled before sports betting went live but had never run into trouble until it appeared on his phone. But he was just really excited for sports. He was a sports fan, and he started betting pretty quickly.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">At some point, I don&#8217;t know when his personal tipping point came, but it came, and gambling went from being something he did as part of his life to being basically his entire life. He wasn&#8217;t going out; he wasn&#8217;t hanging out with friends. He was just gambling. It was so instantly accessible to him. That was all he was doing. And he was drinking, he was smoking more because he was so stressed out from his gambling. He falls behind on his rent. His dad has to bail him out. Things go very badly very quickly.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>To paint a picture: Kyle was making $65,000 a year, and at one point, he wagered close to $93,000 on bets in a single month. Eventually, he gets fired. He goes on unemployment, and then blows all the unemployment money on betting. And then he moves back in with his parents.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah. I picked him because he is a young man, and this is <em>the</em> demographic it&#8217;s happening to. It completely interrupted his life. There’s a black hole in his life for two or three years, where he was consumed by gambling and the stress from gambling and the financial and mental health deterioration wrought by gambling.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why are young men in particular so vulnerable to this?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">First of all, young men are not exactly known for being judicious and careful, especially when it comes to money. They don&#8217;t have great impulse control. You could already imagine how that would set them up poorly for something like this.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">They&#8217;re also — and I&#8217;ll speak for myself as a formerly young male sports fan — overconfident about their knowledge of sports. Sports gambling companies absolutely take advantage of this. There&#8217;s a FanDuel ad saying something like “never waste a hunch,” challenging you to prove that you “know ball” by betting on your hunches.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Young men want to prove to their friends [and] to talk show radio hosts that they know ball, and gambling is presented as a way for them to do so.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">And then [there is] “financial nihilism” among young people and young men in particular. Many young men have disposable income, [but it’s] maybe not so much that they&#8217;re ever going to realistically buy a house or pay off their student loan or start a business. So they might as well gamble.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Whether it&#8217;s on sports betting, whether it&#8217;s on crypto, whether it&#8217;s on stock markets, whether it&#8217;s on video game skins — it&#8217;s not worth having $10,000 in their pocket. It&#8217;s worth having a chance at $100,000 or a million dollars. And they&#8217;re willing, as a result, to gamble and gamble more and gamble in riskier ways than they otherwise would.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What percentage of the industry&#8217;s revenue comes from the Kyles of the world? Not the pros or high rollers — regular working people who are addicted to gambling?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">Sixty percent of betters account for 1 percent of revenue from NFL bets. If you do the flip side, 82 percent of the money is coming from 3 percent of betters. Some of those people I&#8217;ll flag are going to be really rich VIP betters like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/19/sport/phil-mickelson-gambling-addiction-golf-spt-intl">Phil Mickelson</a>, who gambles a ton. But you can imagine there&#8217;s a lot of Kyles caught up in that group or in the interstitial group between them.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What makes online sports betting fundamentally different — and more seductive — than traditional gambling?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">What makes it different from everything that we had before 2018 is the seamlessness. It’s the app design that&#8217;s just as good and just as seamless and just as frictionless as social media or a shopping app. And there’s an endless, endless, endless menu of betting options.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">You can bet on, sure, the LSU Tigers to win the game. You can also bet on whether the first half kickoff is going to be a touchback. And then you can bet on whether the next pitch in a baseball game is going to be 88 miles an hour or faster. You can bet on a tennis serve. And then at 3:00 in the morning when you&#8217;re on this bender, you&#8217;re in this rabbit hole and you lost all [your] money all day, you can bet on Malaysian women&#8217;s doubles badminton.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s not a brick-and-mortar casino. They can&#8217;t pump oxygen into the room. They can’t pull the clocks off the wall like they can at the casino. But they can, with little behavioral nudges, design into the app some of those tricks of the trade.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>When these platforms detect — and they have plenty of data to do it — that someone is trying to wean themselves off betting, or when they spot problematic play, what do they do? Do they leave that person alone and let them wean themselves off? Or do they slam them with promotional credits and deals trying to hook them back in?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">The anecdotal evidence suggests that they do the latter. I’ve seen reports suggesting that they even figure out when your payday is, and they’ll send you more promotional credits and offers on those days.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">The data that they have on gamblers would make Las Vegas of the 1950s weep. It&#8217;s incredible how much data they must have on every single one of us. They claim that this allows them to protect people and to flag users who are betting problematically, who are logging in too many times. But I have seen no indications that that&#8217;s how they&#8217;re using the data. It seems like they&#8217;re instead using it to pair someone who&#8217;s betting a lot with a VIP host and offer behavioral nudges and emails, auspiciously timed to re-engage them and to keep them in the cycle.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do they kick people off when they’re consistently winning? They’re clearly capable of identifying problems and responding to them.</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, absolutely. And some professional gamblers I talked to, they make a habit of every once in a while placing a really, really vanilla ice cream–looking bet. They&#8217;ll bet on Aaron Judge to hit a home run or the LA Lakers to win the championship, because they want to look as stupid as possible, so that the sportsbook thinks that they&#8217;re a normie and not a professional gambler.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Because the second [companies] realize that they&#8217;re a professional gambler or that they can win money, they&#8217;ll just kick them off the platform. But as long as [the professional gamblers] can make [the companies] think they&#8217;re an idiot and that they&#8217;re going to lose or that they&#8217;re addicted, the platforms want to keep them playing.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The industry loves to use phrases like “responsible gambling.” What is your issue with people being personally responsible, Jonathan?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">I don&#8217;t have an issue with personal responsibility, and I do think people have agency and should have agency over their own life. Fine. That being said, it’s not simply that it’s Kyle against the sportsbook. It’s Kyle against a multibillion-dollar corporation that is doing everything in its power to hook him and extract every last dollar of his discretionary income.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">They say, <em>Oh, if you want to set a deposit limit, if you want to set a time limit, you can do that</em>. But [those tools] are rooted in a user opting in to decide to set a time limit, deciding to set a deposit limit.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Fundamentally, what it&#8217;s doing is putting the onus of responsibility of “responsible play” onto the gambler, onto the individual, rather than onto the company to responsibly provision the gambler with a non-addictive product or a product that is not maliciously designed to extract every last dollar that they have in their bank account.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Are there signs that the companies are getting better at this? That policymakers are taking this more seriously in terms of identifying problem gamblers and offering resources to help them get over that problem?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">Not on their own. If there’s a reason for hope, I would say it&#8217;s coming from outside.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">There are advocacy groups that are filing class action lawsuits over some of these companies&#8217; most insidious behaviors, these crazy promotions that offer $25,000 in bonus cash, but you actually need to bet $100,000 to get the $25,000 bonus or whatever it may be. There’s also a lawsuit ongoing in New Jersey over VIP hosts, the company&#8217;s employees whose job it is to find big bettors and keep them betting.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe we&#8217;re going to have some of the regulation that I wished we had initially had seven years ago. To the degree that there was momentum for it, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s coming yet from the companies themselves, as much as it is from advocates who are waking up to the harms.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/america-is-losing-big-on-sports-betting/id1081584611?i=1000721477575"><em>Listen to the rest of the conversation</em></a><em> and be sure to follow </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/thegrayarea"><em>The Gray Area</em></a><em> on </em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP"><em>Spotify</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793"><em>Pandora</em></a><em>, or wherever you listen to podcasts.</em></p>

Dunne&#8217;s dad Dominick is a summer novel staple (maybe you too want to lay on a beach and read about how society ladies were mean to each other), but it turns out his rakish actor son has lived a life of fun fodder. From his childhood attending parties alongside Sean Connery to his best-friendship with Carrie Fisher, the book is full of glamour, family feuds, mistakes, and at least one visit to an orgy.<br><br>It also provides a front-row seat to one of the most devastating domestic violence murders in the American public consciousness, as Griffin navigates life after his sister Dominique&#8217;s murder.

I’ve really enjoyed his poetry collections and other novels, but this has become my favorite book of his by far. It’s about a teen who’s struggling deeply while living in a declining town in Connecticut. He’s literally pulled back from the edge by an elderly widow and he ends up becoming her live-in caretaker. The bond they form is beautiful, and the story also dives into his experiences working at a fast-casual restaurant, which is deeply relatable to anyone who&#8217;s worked in a similar environment. His writing is immensely poetic and continues to leave me thinking about dignity, memory, class, and survival.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">—<strong>Gabby Fernandez</strong>, <em>associate director, audience</em></p><hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><a href="https://link.vox.com/click/41016696.0/aHR0cHM6Ly9ib29rc2hvcC5vcmcvcC9ib29rcy9saWZlLWFuZC1mYXRlLWludHJvZHVjdGlvbi1ieS1wb2xseS1qb25lcy12YXNpbHktZ3Jvc3NtYW4vMTcyNjAyNTE_dWVpZD0yMzQ2M2I5OWI2MmE3MmYyNmVkNjc3Y2M1NTZjNDRlOA/000000000000000000000000Deb328ca6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Life and Fate</em></a></strong><a href="https://link.vox.com/click/41016696.0/aHR0cHM6Ly9ib29rc2hvcC5vcmcvcC9ib29rcy9saWZlLWFuZC1mYXRlLWludHJvZHVjdGlvbi1ieS1wb2xseS1qb25lcy12YXNpbHktZ3Jvc3NtYW4vMTcyNjAyNTE_dWVpZD0yMzQ2M2I5OWI2MmE3MmYyNmVkNjc3Y2M1NTZjNDRlOA/000000000000000000000000Eeb328ca6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>&nbsp;by Vasily Grossman</strong></a>, which I recently completed, was one of the best books I’ve ever read, it’s essentially&nbsp;<em>War and Peace&nbsp;</em>for the Eastern Front of World War II.

Set far enough in the future that there are self-driving cars with grouchy personalities and chess-playing AIs capable of emotional conversations, but close enough to now that upper-middle-class Manhattan parents are still obsessed with getting their kids into the right colleges, <em>Vera</em> tracks a kind of familial awakening for a 9-year-old girl named Vera grappling with a family that&#8217;s falling apart and a country that&#8217;s outright collapsing over Trumpian nativism gone wild. It&#8217;s Shteyngart, so of course it&#8217;s funny — he may be the one novelist who is actually amusing on X — but what makes it break through is Vera, who will take her place among the great precocious protagonists of literature.

When the project gets axed and all of the colonists are ordered to return home, Ofelia decides to stay behind, so that she can finally be alone, for once. Solitude all too often gets framed as an awful thing, but here it’s full of joy and replenishment.

Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House August 11, 2025, in Washington, DC. | Andrew Harnik/Getty Images	</figcaption></figure><p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump’s federal takeover of Washington, DC’s police force — which looks like something between an authoritarian <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/458215/trump-dc-deployment-national-guard-absurd">power grab and an empty stunt</a> — doesn’t look like a political winner at first glance.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/08/11/6372b/4">poll from YouGov</a> last week showed little support for Trump’s move; 34 percent of respondents approved of the idea, and 47 percent disapproved.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Yet the pushback from Democrats — which often focused on <a href="https://x.com/RepJeffries/status/1954926861882110385">pointing out</a> that DC crime was trending downward, or arguing it wasn’t such a serious problem — shows why the larger crime issue remains perilous for them, and advantageous for Trump.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Though Trump is unpopular, crime remains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej3Veavq_QI">one of his strongest issues</a>, and one of the <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/52266-americans-trust-the-democratic-party-more-on-health-care-and-republicans-more-on-immigration">Democratic Party’s worst</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">That sticks in Democrats’ craw. Trump’s recitation of DC crime statistics was filled with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/12/us/politics/trump-dc-crime-data-fact-check.html">blatant misrepresentations</a>. Furthermore, Trump himself was indicted four times, and he notably pardoned even the violent rioters of January 6, 2021. How could they be losing the law and order issue to this guy?</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Yet the polling says very clearly that they are.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Polls consistently show the public prefers Republicans to Democrats on crime</h2><p class="has-text-align-none">In May, separate polls from both <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25957941/cnn-poll-june-1.pdf">CNN</a> and <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/52266-americans-trust-the-democratic-party-more-on-health-care-and-republicans-more-on-immigration">YouGov</a> asked respondents about which party they trusted more on over a dozen different issues,&nbsp;and both found that crime was the Democrats’ worst of all. (The GOP had a 13-point advantage in one poll, and a 12-point advantage in the other.)</p><p class="has-text-align-none">It hasn’t always been this way. Even as recently as 2021, the two parties <a href="https://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1225a12022Politics.pdf">were about evenly matched</a> in polling from Langer Research. But in 2022, the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-strong-crime-boosted-trust-inflation-poll/story?id=84403842">GOP’s advantage on crime</a> surged to its highest in decades of the firm’s polling — and it hasn’t gone away since.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">That’s for a pretty straightforward reason: A large majority of the public became convinced, due to very real rising crime rates, that crime in cities had become a very serious problem and that tougher policies are necessary — but Democrats often don’t seem like they feel the same way.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">The crime rates have since declined, but voter concerns haven’t gone away. In last week’s <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/poll-americans-truly-think-trump-000000428.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIFAwFsdSJj5bzuBnGTXSKvkK_by8A2pxLvSxZ4hsytQUSPn7ZbHUBfZM10deM05zb4F4MrGFvdiOjtCt-a6Q0ah3guHcUiTt3EqhpOPGdXu95Vau3XfyRXt2Vf6D1Tlqz8dOjz4GhzSd4GhuAG8SsMfXpfpI4xNV7rOsedXJkfP">YouGov poll</a>, a large majority — 67 percent — believed crime was a major problem in US cities, and only 23 percent thought it was a minor problem.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">And back in April 2024, the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/06/06/crime-policing-and-the-2024-election/">Pew Research Center</a> asked registered voters whether they believed the US criminal justice system was generally too tough on criminals, or not tough enough. It wasn’t even close. A mere 13 percent chose “too tough,” while 61 percent said “not tough enough.”</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, even a plurality of Biden supporters (40 percent of them) believed the system was “not tough enough,” while just 21 percent of them thought it was too tough. Among the public, the belief that the criminal justice system is overly harsh on criminals is a fringe view. But among progressive activists, it’s a core belief.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Democrats have a crime problem</h2><p class="has-text-align-none">For the past decade, the intellectual and organizing energy among progressive criminal justice activists has been around preventing police violence and making sentencing of criminals more lenient. In these circles, distrust of police and law enforcement and disdain for mass incarceration were widespread, and concern about crime in cities became viewed as racially coded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Responding to these pressures, Democratic politicians struck an increasingly awkward balance on crime issues. They’ve tried to disavow “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/3/21276824/defund-police-divest-explainer">defund the police</a>,” and big city mayors who have crime-concerned constituents <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/523-22/transcript-mayor-eric-adams-launches-street-homeless-advocacy-project">have tried to get tough</a>. But it hasn’t been enough to change the party’s brand.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Why not? Another <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50797-crime-what-2024-voters-want-and-which-candidate-they-trust">YouGov poll</a> — taken in September 2024 — asked respondents about several of then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris’s criminal justice policy proposals and Trump’s. Harris’s specific proposals were generally more popular.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">But on the question of who would do a better job handling crime? Trump had an 8-point advantage.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">That’s because voters don’t make up their minds by tallying a policy laundry list. They look for signals about “whose side are you on?” And Trump has signaled in many ways that he’s on the “tough on crime” side. Democrats’ signals have been more mixed.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">So when Democrats are tempted to say anyone worried about DC’s crime level is ignorant, a scaredy-cat, or a demagogue, they should be aware they’re going out on a limb.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">While voters may think Trump is going too far or mishandling certain cases, the broader crime issue remains favorable to him. It will take some serious work for Democrats to change that perception. Crime remains one of the party’s most glaring political weaknesses.</p>

	Someone dressed as a donkey at the Democratic National Convention on August 19, 2024, in Chicago.﻿ | Demetrius Freeman/Washington Post via Getty Images	</figcaption></figure><p class="has-text-align-none">Polling is “90 percent bullshit.” In fact, <em>all</em> political data is “garbage.” The Democratic consultants who traffic in such numbers are perpetrating a “scam” against their own party and are largely responsible for President Donald Trump’s victories. Instead of trying to gauge public opinion through pseudo-scientific surveys, Democrats should mostly just read history and the classics.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">This is the gist of John Ganz’s recent column, “<a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/against-polling">Against Polling</a>” — a widely shared polemic that actually <a href="https://x.com/gelliottmorris/status/1953196337455149289?s=46">earned plaudits</a> from some Democratic <a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1953249814742810774">pollsters</a>.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Both this piece and its reception are puzzling. Ganz is a brilliant writer with many insightful things to say about <a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/the-third-republic-and-today">history</a> and <a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/gramscians-vs-sorelians-c97857e67f35">political philosophy</a>. (I recommend subscribing to <a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/">his newsletter</a> and <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374605445/whentheclockbroke/">buying his book</a>.) Yet his diatribe against “data” is unfair and unpersuasive. He patently<em></em>mischaracterizes the positions he’s arguing against and provides little evidence for his own. He does not acknowledge some obvious objections to his anti-empiricism, let alone rebut them. His piece’s valid assertions are uncontested while its contentious ones are unvalidated. </p><p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, it was warmly received, even by some whose vocations it disparaged.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">I’m not certain why this is. But I fear that Ganz’s argument is appealing for the very reason it undermines clear-eyed thinking about electoral politics: It offers an elaborate rationalization for dismissing any data one does not like.</p><div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight"><h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story was first featured in The Rebuild. </h2><p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/385161/the-rebuild-newsletter-sign-up-democratic-party-liberals-progressives" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/politics/385161/the-rebuild-newsletter-sign-up-democratic-party-liberals-progressives">Sign up here</a> for more stories on the lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz. </p></div><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Ganz makes some valid points (that no one actually disputes)</strong></h2><p class="has-text-align-none">Ganz’s critique is aimed at both political data in general, and a specific set of ideas about Democratic electoral strategy: principally, the notion that Democratic candidates should seek to increase the salience of their popular positions, avoid talking much about their unpopular ones, and give greater deference to public opinion than the party presently does. This basic outlook is often described as “popularism” (a hideous but useful neologism). And it is championed by, among others, the Democratic data scientist <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/403364/tik-tok-young-voters-2024-election-democrats-david-shor">David Shor</a>, the commentator (and a Vox co-founder) <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/what-was-the-popularism-debate">Matt Yglesias</a>, and less prominently (and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/410137/abrego-garcia-van-hollen-democrats-trump-deportation-el-salvador">more equivocally</a>) myself. </p><p class="has-text-align-none">In prosecuting his case against popularism, Ganz says many things that are inarguably true. For example — after spending the bulk of his column arguing that public opinion data is “garbage” and “90 percent bullshit” — he retreats to the claim that polling is “<em>part</em> of getting a picture of the world,” just “not the entirety of it.”</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Needless to say, the idea that polling shouldn’t be your <em>only</em> tool for discerning reality and the idea that polling is almost entirely fraudulent are pretty different. The first claim is indisputable; the trouble is that no one disputes it.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">This is the problem with virtually all of Ganz’s valid assertions. He correctly observes that polling is flawed, that public opinion isn’t fixed, that not all useful knowledge about politics is quantifiable, and that there is more to good campaigning than mirroring the public’s policy preferences. But he does not quote a single Democratic consultant or commentator who rejects these truisms, likely because none do.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of refuting the popularists’ actual ideas, Ganz rebuts an absurd ideology of his own invention. He writes that “the worldview of the data guys is based on a giant mistake” — namely, that “there’s an objective world out there, and it doesn’t change.”&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Yet no serious person has ever claimed that public opinion doesn’t change. It obviously does. And this is not lost on the “data guys.” David Shor, to take one example, has argued that Democratic politicians have <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/david-shor-cancel-culture-2020-election-theory-polls.html">the power to reshape</a> many of their base voters’ views, that the Supreme Court decision in <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</em><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/11/election-results-who-won-the-midterms-david-shor.html">made Americans more liberal</a> on abortion, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/403364/tik-tok-young-voters-2024-election-democrats-david-shor">and that</a> “what people care about and trust [the Democrats] on really is responsive to concrete events that happen in the world.”</p><p class="has-text-align-none">On this point, the actual dispute between Ganz and the popularists is not about whether public opinion can change, but about how much<em></em>scope <em>Democratic politicians </em>have to reshape the views of swing voters — which is to say, voters who do not particularly trust Democratic politicians.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Everyone recognizes that this scope is limited. Most progressives would doubtlessly agree that Democrats can’t persuade swing voters to support large new taxes on meat. There may be a strong moral case for making steak more expensive, given the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics">cruelty and ecological harms</a> inherent to large-scale animal agriculture. Were Democrats to campaign on the case for making meat less affordable, however, they would surely do less to change swing voters’ views on factory farming than to poison the Democratic Party’s image. I seriously doubt that Ganz would contest this.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Assuming he doesn’t, then the debate on this point isn’t about whether Democrats must acquiesce to the public’s existing preferences on some subjects. Rather, it is about 1) <em>what</em> those subjects are and 2) how they can be identified.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">These are difficult questions. To answer them, one must make not only empirical judgments but normative ones (chiefly, about how Democratic politicians should weigh the risk of alienating voters against the benefits of evangelizing for worthy causes). It is reasonable to argue that Shor, Yglesias, or any other “data guy” gets these questions wrong. But demonstrating that requires engaging with their actual premises, not shredding a caricature of their worldview.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Did Democratic pollsters misjudge the politics of immigration?</strong></h2><p class="has-text-align-none">Ganz comes closest to addressing the data guys’ actual views in his discussion of immigration.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">In 2024 — and during the early months of Trump’s presidency — popularists encouraged Democrats to focus on the electorate’s economic concerns, rather than emphasizing the moral case against Trump’s mass deportation plan. Ganz argues that this was a mistake, one rooted in an overvaluation of polling data and an underestimation of the electorate’s moral judgment.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">His argument is as follows: Polling in 2024 <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/19/poll-americans-mass-deportation-policies-trump">indicated</a> that voters agreed with Trump about mass deportation. This led the popularists to discourage Democrats from attacking the cruelty of Trump’s vision. But surveys on this subject were fundamentally misleading: Most voters did not harbor any deep commitment to purging the country of hardworking, law-abiding immigrants. And once people actually saw what Trump’s policy entailed, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-poll-trump-deportation-program-prices/">they recoiled in horror</a>. Now, a majority of Americans <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/donald-trump/issues/immigration">disapprove</a> of the president’s handling of immigration.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">In Ganz’s view, we should not blame the public for failing to anticipate the consequences of Trump’s agenda, but rather, the “lazy politicians” and “craven advisers” who prevented Democrats from alerting voters to those harms. By refusing to appeal to the electorate’s “faculties of judgement and imagination,” Ganz suggests that the “data guys” abetted Trump’s election.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">There are many problems with this argument. But most derive from two unsound assumptions at the core of Ganz’s reasoning:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>If voters soured on Trump’s immigration agenda after witnessing its effects in 2025, then Democrats could have changed their minds about that agenda in 2024, had the party only helped Americans picture those effects.</li><li>If voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, then the Democratic Party must not have any interest in reducing that subject’s salience relative to economic issues.</li></ul><p class="has-text-align-none">On the first point, it simply isn’t true that Democrats failed to warn voters about what mass deportation would entail. To the contrary, on the campaign trail last <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2024/harris-hits-trumps-promise-of-mass-deportations-as-trump-rallies-on-long-island/">September</a>, then-Vice President Kamala Harris <em>explicitly</em> appealed to voters’ “faculties of judgement and imagination” on this subject, warning that Trump had “pledged to carry out the largest deportation, a mass deportation, in American history. Imagine what that would look like and what that would be? How’s that going to happen? Massive raids? Massive detention camps?”</p><p class="has-text-align-none">At the time of these remarks, Democrats had been <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/hillary-clinton-campaign-press-release-hillary-for-america-statement-trumps-mass">making versions</a> of this argument for nearly a decade. At one point during that period, Trump had used presidential power to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/18/17475810/immigration-family-separation-health-crisis">separate migrant parents from their children</a>, in a notorious scandal. If all this wasn’t enough to persuade swing voters that Trump’s approach to immigration was intolerably cruel, why should we be confident that Harris could have convinced them of as much, if only she’d made the case more forcefully?</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Ganz offers evidence that public opinion on immigration is sensitive to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/briefing/us-immigration-surge.html">shifts</a> in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/us/politics/border-crossings-trump.html">objective conditions</a> and media coverage. But it doesn’t follow that such opinion is highly responsive to Democratic rhetoric.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Yet there is a more basic problem with Ganz’s case: Current polling <em>still</em> indicates that immigration is a source of relative strength for Trump and weakness for the Democratic Party.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">In RealClearPolitics’s polling average, immigration remains Trump’s best issue, with voters disapproving of the president’s handling of that subject <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/donald-trump/issues/immigration">by only 5 percentage points</a> as of August 15. By contrast, voters disapprove of Trump’s <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/donald-trump/issues/inflation">management of inflation</a> by 20.5 points, and of <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/approval/donald-trump/issues/economy">the economy</a> more broadly by 11.6 points as of the same time.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">More critically, some recent polling indicates that voters still prefer Trump’s cruel brand of immigration enforcement to the Democratic Party’s perceived laxity on the issue. In <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/democratic-party-poll-voter-confidence-july-2025-9db38021?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhTXByk1YMVO-uTgWsQ-MDditNUNWdRVkTGfmJTd7PVqb7d6PIRsOCkEqyHSmE%3D&amp;gaa_ts=689cf362&amp;gaa_sig=zcG9yAYt_iSfIKV2rARCRXvujYm0Q2i59sah45rRUmuoTj0ZkLcuB4-86ndsus8p7Nm2Gt4x2Ruq1f4Wjl4QGw%3D%3D">a July Wall Street Journal poll,</a> voters said that they trust Republicans more than Democrats to handle immigration by a 17-point margin. On illegal immigration, meanwhile, voters favored the GOP by <em>24</em><em>points.</em>&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Therefore, the popularists’ basic proposition on this subject — that Democrats have an interest in emphasizing economic issues over immigration — is as plausible today as it was in 2024.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, none of this necessarily means that Democrats shouldn’t spotlight the cruelty of Trump’s immigration policies, for non-electoral reasons. In my own view, the popularists can get monomaniacally fixated on political optimization, at the expense of other considerations. Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen’s decision to agitate for the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/410137/abrego-garcia-van-hollen-democrats-trump-deportation-el-salvador">release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia</a> — an immigrant whom Trump unlawfully deported to El Salvador — may or may not have marginally increased the Democrats’ odds of winning the 2026 midterms. But doing so brought comfort to a longtime US resident who was suffering in a nightmarish foreign prison. That seems worthwhile.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Ganz does not frame his case against popularism in purely moral terms. Rather, he asserts that the “data guys” are specifically wrong about how to win elections — <em>so</em> wrong that their polling amounts to “garbage” and a “scam.” His only evidence for this extremely strong claim is that public opinion about immigration has changed since 2024.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, Ganz is guilty of precisely what he accuses the “data guys” of doing: drawing sweeping conclusions on the basis of a myopic and incurious reading of cherry-picked polling data.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>If empiricism is dead, then everything is permitted</strong></h2><p class="has-text-align-none">It is easy to enumerate the liabilities of polling and election data analysis. The real difficulty lies in naming alternative methods for ascertaining political reality that are more reliable and less vulnerable to motivated reasoning. And Ganz fails to meet that challenge.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">He argues that politics is an art — not a science — and can therefore only be mastered through humanistic methods: There is no alternative to studying “the words and actions of politicians past” and the vast philosophical literature on effective rhetoric, beginning with the ancient Greeks. FDR’s oratory may not offer the precise guidance of polling, message tests, or elaborate statistical analyses of election results. But Ganz argues that such number crunching can obscure more than it reveals by abstracting away essential context, which can only be captured through a qualitative examination of political history and the classics.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">It’s surely true that some useful political knowledge can’t be represented mathematically, and that history is an indispensable supplement to political science. Yet as a tool for anticipating how voters will respond to a given agenda or message, the humanistic study of “politicians past” has obvious flaws.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">For one thing, as Ganz himself emphasizes, public opinion changes over time. Rhetorical tactics and substantive positions that worked in the past may therefore have less purchase in the present. Polling can offer a portrait of contemporary attitudes; history can’t.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Further, what history and the classics tell us about optimal electoral strategy in 2025 is <em>extremely</em> indeterminate: By focusing on distinct historical examples or emphasizing different pieces of context, one can draw an enormous variety of different conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, one can apply quantitative tools in biased ways. But scientific methods impose far greater constraints on motivated reasoning than humanistic inquiry does. Rigorous polling can falsify one’s assumptions about public opinion (or at least, cast them into doubt). Analyses of which candidates have outperformed their party in recent elections can validate or undermine certain theories of political best practice. By contrast, no one has ever learned that their policy preferences were unpopular by reading Aristotle.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Ganz’s piece unintentionally illustrates his method’s susceptibility to biased reasoning. To appreciate how, it’s worth quoting his conclusion at length:</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The statistical fixation of the early 21st century that’s made so many bad predictions and fathered so many puzzling defeats must be abandoned. We are not in an era of small calculations but of great movements. Politicians with a vision and a strong, clear rhetorical appeal, like Trump, Bernie, AOC, and now Mamdani, are those who excite people.&nbsp;People become disappointed and disillusioned when they lapse into focus-group-tested canting. Say something for a change.</em></p></blockquote><p class="has-text-align-none">It’s difficult to say exactly what Ganz is asserting here, since his language is a bit vague and aphoristic. If you squint, you could read him as merely asserting a bunch of truisms (it is bad for a politician to speak in canned lines that sound inauthentic; charisma matters; having an energized base is desirable, all else equal).<br><br>In the most straightforward reading, though, Ganz appears to be making at least three contentious propositions:</p><ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Democrats’ recent defeats were caused by excessive deference to public opinion data.</li><li>Trump’s success demonstrates that paying close heed to polling is less important than offering a vision that excites people and mobilizes a “great movement.” </li><li>For a model of the type of Democratic politics that works in our era, one should look to Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.</li></ul><p class="has-text-align-none">None of these claims are self-evidently true. On the first point, one could just as easily assert that Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris lost because they paid <em>too little</em> attention to opinion polling, rather than too much. After all, both declined to embrace many majoritarian positions that contradicted progressive principles. And Harris famously ignored the counsel of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/future-forward-pac-kamala-harris/683154/">data-driven Democratic consultants</a>, who had implored her to focus less on “democracy” and more on the cost of living.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, it’s not obvious that Trump has been more successful than a less charismatic, but more moderate and disciplined, Republican would have been in his place. It’s worth remembering that Trump 1) lost the popular vote by 2 million ballots in 2016, despite running against a <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/289384-gop-clinton-is-most-unpopular-dem-nominee-ever/">historically disliked</a> Democratic nominee, 2) lost the presidency in 2020, despite running against a senescent man who could <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/second-democratic-primary-debate-winners-losers-ranked-harris-biden.html">not reliably speak in coherent sentences</a>, 3) won narrowly in 2024, even with the tailwind of a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/global-elections-2024-incumbents-defeated-c80fbd4e667de86fe08aac025b333f95">global anti-incumbent backlash</a>, and 4) through it all, has had an unusually low approval rating (for a president or party leader).&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">It is entirely possible that Republicans would have done much worse over the past nine years, had they been led by a straitlaced moderate with poorly attended rallies. But how does Ganz know that?</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, it’s difficult to see a firm basis for selecting Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Zohran Mamdani as exemplars of effective Democratic politics in 2025. All are gifted politicians. And I think there are things that the broader Democratic Party can <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/417776/zohran-mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-policies-democrats">learn from each</a>. Yet they have collectively won <em>zero</em> general elections outside of New York City and Vermont — two of the most Democratic jurisdictions in America. And Mamdani has a <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2025/08/mamdani-leads-cuomo-19-points-while-stefanik-catching-hochul/407379/">negative 9 percent favorability rating</a> in New York state, according to a Siena College poll released this week.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">The challenge facing Democrats today is not how to win a New York City mayoral election, but how to win presidential races in Pennsylvania and Senate contests in North Carolina. And Ganz offers no evidence that appealing to majoritarian opinion in those places (as measured through scientific methods) is less important than exciting “great movements,” in the manner that Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and Mamdani have. </p><p class="has-text-align-none">All of which is to say: By dismissing “scientific” methods of evaluating claims about political reality, Ganz enables himself to draw strong conclusions about how Democrats can best disempower the GOP — without providing much in the way of substantiation or even argument. And those conclusions happen to be ideologically convenient for Ganz, whose social democratic politics are well-represented by Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and Mamdani.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">This is what I find insidious about his whole argument: It serves to insulate progressives’ intuitions about electoral politics from any empirical challenge.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Progressives have strong incentives to engage in wishful thinking about electoral politics</h2><p class="has-text-align-none">This is a problem, not least because the left’s political intuitions are liable to be biased, unless disciplined by data.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Left-wing activists and public intellectuals have strong incentives to believe that there are minimal tensions between the progressive movement’s factional project (to pull Democrats leftward) and the Democratic Party’s electoral one (to disempower the Republican Party). If there were large trade-offs between these two endeavors, then such progressives might have a moral obligation to counsel some form of moderation. After all, as the Trump administration demonstrates on a near-daily basis, the stakes of keeping the authoritarian right out of power are extremely high.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Yet one cannot advocate for a more ideologically cautious Democratic Party without risking estrangement from other progressives. In principle, there is no reason why it couldn’t be true that social democracy is the most just political system <em>and</em> that — at this particular point in history — the Democratic Party would win many more elections if it moderated on some issues. The latter is an empirical judgment, not a normative one. Yet to articulate this view as a progressive is to jeopardize your sense of belonging and esteem among those who share your moral commitments. Doing so is sure to get you derisively branded as a “centrist.” Some progressive writers may even feel comfortable calling you a “craven” scammer without evidence.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, anyone who finds community and identity in progressive politics — a group that includes a large share of Democratic operatives, staffers, and commentators — is liable to err on the side of underestimating the political utility of moderation. Polling and election data are the only real checks on such a bias. And Ganz’s piece provides a rationalization for dismissing them.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is to say that the popularists are necessarily right about how Democrats can win elections, much less about how the party should balance the dictates of principle against those of political expediency. The latter is an inescapably value-laden question, which data cannot resolve. Yet you can’t formulate a morally serious answer to that dilemma without a plausible conception of political reality. And scientific methods remain our best tools for forming such a conception. For all of polling’s flaws, there is still no better way to find out what voters think than to ask them (or more specifically, a representative sample of them, using maximally neutral question wordings). And for all the <a href="https://split-ticket.org/2025/08/15/deconstructing-war/">methodological disputes</a> among political scientists, there is still no better way to discern which types of candidates most voters favor than to rigorously examine whom they elect.</p>

	Proponents for affirmative action in higher education rally in front of the US Supreme Court on October 31, 2022, in Washington, DC. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images	</figcaption></figure><p class="has-text-align-none">President Donald Trump’s administration is scrutinizing higher education. Last week, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/08/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-transparency-in-higher-education-admissions/">White House issued a memorandum</a> requiring all universities receiving federal funds to submit admissions data on all applicants to the Department of Education. The goal is to enforce the <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2022/20-1199">2023 Supreme Court decision</a> that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/370854/affirmative-action-black-enrollment-universities-diversity-supreme-court">ended race-based affirmative action</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Days before the memo was released, Columbia and Brown agreed to share their admissions data with the administration, broken down by race, grade point average, and standardized test scores. The administration suspects that universities are using “racial proxies” to get around the ban on race-based admissions. The Department of Education is expected to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5443414-trump-college-admissions-transparency/">build a database</a> of the admissions data and make it available to parents and students.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Amid this increased federal scrutiny, an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/us/richard-kahlenberg-affirmative-action.html">alternative idea from Richard Kahlenberg</a>, director of the American Identity Project for the Progressive Policy Institute, is gaining attention. Kahlenberg, who testified in the Supreme Court cases against Harvard and UNC, advocates for class-based affirmative action instead of race-based admissions. He argues that this approach will yield more economically and racially equitable results.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Today, Explained</em> co-host Noel King spoke with <a href="https://www.richardkahlenberg.org/">Kahlenberg</a> about how he contends with the consequences of helping gut race-based affirmative action, why he believes class-based affirmative action is the path forward, and if his own argument may come in the crosshairs of a Trump administration eager to stamp out all forms of affirmative action.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> wherever you get podcasts, including <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/today-explained/PC:140">Pandora</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A">Spotify</a>.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You’re the director of the American Identity Project at the </strong><a href="https://www.progressivepolicy.org/people/richard-d-kahlenberg/"><strong>Progressive Policy Institute</strong></a><strong>. I would take it to mean that you are a progressive.</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">It’s complicated these days. I’m left of center. I think of myself more as liberal than progressive.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I ask because you </strong><a href="https://www.theassemblync.com/education/higher-education/kahlenberg-future-of-affirmative-action/"><strong>testified as an expert witness </strong></a><strong>for the plaintiffs in the case </strong><strong><em>Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College.</em></strong><strong> This is the case that essentially gutted race-based affirmative action. It doesn’t sound like a progressive, or even a left-of-center, position. What was going on? Explain what you were thinking.</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve long been a supporter of racial diversity in colleges. I think that’s enormously important, but I’ve been troubled that elite colleges were racially integrated, but economically segregated.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">I think there’s a better way of creating racial diversity — a more liberal way, if you will — which is to give low-income and economically disadvantaged students of all races a leg up in the admissions process in order to create both racial and economic diversity.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What was the data that you looked at that led you to believe that? Were primarily wealthy Black and Hispanic students benefiting from affirmative action?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">There’d been a <a href="https://nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/a-middle-ground-on-race-and-college">number of studies over the years</a> that had come to that conclusion, including from supporters of race-based affirmative action. Then, in the litigation, further evidence came out. At Harvard, 71 percent of the Black and Hispanic students came from the <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2025/08/12/diversity-campus-college-trump-class">most socioeconomically privileged</a> 20 percent of the Black and Hispanic population nationally.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Now, to be clear, the white and Asian students were even richer. But for the most part, this was not a program that was <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/writer-predicts-more-socioeconomically-diverse-colleges-after-end-of-affirmative-action">benefiting working-class and low-income students</a>.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Alright, so the Supreme Court in 2023 hands down this decision that says, essentially, we’re </strong><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/29/1181138066/affirmative-action-supreme-court-decision"><strong>done with race-based affirmative action</strong></a><strong>. Was there a difference in how progressives and conservatives interpreted the Supreme Court ruling?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">Most mainstream conservatives have always said they were opposed to racial preferences, but of course, they were for economic affirmative action. But now we have some on the extreme, including the Trump administration, saying that <a href="https://www.ed.gov/media/document/dear-colleague-letter-sffa-v-harvard-109506.pdf">economic affirmative action is also illegal</a> if part of the rationale for the policy is seeking to increase racial diversity.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do you make of that? That was your team once upon a time, right?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">Well, I think it’s troubling when people shift the goalposts. In a number of the Supreme Court concurring opinions in the case, conservatives said that economic affirmative action made a lot of sense. Justice [Neil] Gorsuch, for example, said if Harvard got rid of legacy preferences and instead gave economic affirmative action, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf">that would be perfectly legal</a>. And now some extremists are shifting their position and saying they’re opposed to any kind of affirmative action.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Are you surprised by that shift?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">I’m not surprised. I’m confident, however, that a majority of the US Supreme Court won’t go that far. The Supreme Court, to some degree, <a href="https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1074&amp;context=jcl">looks to public opinion</a>. Racial preferences were always unpopular. But economic affirmative action is <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/317006/affirmative-action-public-opinion.aspx">broadly supported by the public</a>.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court has had two cases come before it, subsequent to the <em>&nbsp;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard </em>decision. One involved a challenge to class-based affirmative action at Thomas Jefferson High School in Northern Virginia, and the other involved an attack on a similar class-based affirmative action program at the Boston exam schools, like Boston Latin. In both cases, the Supreme Court said we’re not gonna hear those cases over the vehement dissent of a couple of extremely conservative justices. So I’m fairly confident that the Supreme Court will not go down the path of striking down economic-based preferences.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do you make of this move by the Trump administration to ask colleges for data?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">I’m of two minds about it. I do think transparency is good in higher education. These institutions are receiving lots of taxpayer money. We want to make sure they’re following the Supreme Court ruling, which said you can’t use race.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Having said that, I’m quite nervous about how the Trump administration will use the data, because if a college discloses the average SAT scores and grades by race of applicants, of those admitted, and then those enrolled, one of two things can be going on. One is that the university’s cheating and they’re using racial preferences, and that would be a violation of the law.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">The other possibility is that they <em>did</em> shift to economic affirmative action, <a href="https://sites.uab.edu/humanrights/2024/01/21/the-impact-of-overturning-affirmative-action-on-low-income-and-first-generation-students-and-what-colleges-can-do-to-move-forward/">which is perfectly legal</a>.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">And because <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/education-inequalities-at-the-school-starting-gate/">Black and Hispanic students are disproportionately low income and working class</a>, they will disproportionately benefit from a class-based affirmative action program. And so the average SAT score is going to look somewhat lower. I’m worried that the Trump administration will go after both race-based and class-based affirmative action.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Because class-based affirmative action still might mean a college is admitting more Black and Hispanic students. And </strong><a href="https://www.ed.gov/media/document/dear-colleague-letter-sffa-v-harvard-109506.pdf"><strong>what the Trump administration seems to have the issue with is that fact</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">Yes. Increasingly, that’s what it looks like. As long as the Trump administration was focused on counting race and deciding who gets ahead, they had the American public on their side. But <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/16/americans-and-affirmative-action-how-the-public-sees-the-consideration-of-race-in-college-admissions-hiring/">Americans also support the idea of racially integrated student bodies</a>, they just don’t like racial preferences as the means for getting there. So, if Trump says, no matter how you achieve this racial diversity, I’m just opposed to racial diversity, he’ll have lost the public. And I don’t think he will be consistent with the legal framework under <em>Students for Fair Admissions,</em> either.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do you think he cares?</strong></p><p class="has-text-align-none">Well, I think he ought to care if he cares about the future of his political party. Because under class-based affirmative action, it is true that Black and Hispanic students will disproportionately benefit, but it will also benefit white working-class students. And those are the students who are coming from families that form the <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/its-not-the-economy-stupid-the-ideological-foundations-of-white-working-class-republicanism/">base of the Republican Party.</a> So I think it would be a big mistake if the Trump administration were to really push hard on that angle.</p>

Which means, of course, they will become eligible to engage in that time-honored habit of adulthood: drinking alcohol. (I’m sure absolutely none of them did so before they turned 21. I certainly did not, or at least, would not admit to doing so in this piece, which I know my parents read.)</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Yet those who get the chance to legally order a beer or a wine or, God help them, a Long Island iced tea, may find the bar a little less crowded these days. According to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/693362/drinking-rate-new-low-alcohol-concerns-surge.aspx">new survey released by Gallup this week</a>, just 54 percent of Americans now say they drink alcohol. That’s the lowest share since Gallup began tracking the question way back in 1939, six years after Prohibition was repealed.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/zEAG1-fewer-americans-report-drinking-alcohol-than-ever-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" /><p class="has-text-align-none">Even Americans who do continue to drink say they are drinking less, and say they’re increasingly concerned about the health impacts of alcohol. A narrow majority of Americans say that even moderate drinking is unhealthy, while reported drinking frequency also hit record lows. (Only 24 percent reported having a drink over the past 24 hours, while 40 percent said it had been more than a week since their last glass.) And while you might be skeptical of self-reporting drinking habits — <a href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/blog/blurred-lines">doctors certainly are</a> — the most recent sales data says that per-capita ethanol consumption in the US <a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/sites/default/files/surveillance-report121.pdf">has fallen</a> from nearly 2.8 gallons in the early 1980s to around 2.5 in 2022.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Unless you happen to be in the booze business, this shift is 100-proof good news (with a few caveats). Drinking can lead to various social and medical ills, from the familial and financial devastation of alcoholism at the high end to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667%2822%2900317-6/fulltext">increases in the risk of cancer and other diseases</a> even at the lower end.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">But in a culture which seems to celebrate and encourage drinking, what’s up with more Americans putting down their glasses?</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">No safe level</h2><p class="has-text-align-none">Americans of a certain age — i.e., me — probably remember hearing that a glass of red wine a day could be good for you. Which, looking back, seems absurd. Ethanol <a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/what-does-drinking-alcohol-do-to-your-body.h00-159696756.html#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20the%20National%20Institutes,Alcohol%20isn't%20nutritious">in any form is a toxin</a>. But thanks in part to what became <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9949795/">known as the “French paradox”</a> — the fact that the French showed low levels of heart disease despite their love of rich, fatty foods and glasses of Bordeaux — conventional wisdom settled on the idea that moderate drinking could actually benefit our overall health.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">If only. In the <a href="https://myrtlebeachrecovery.com/whats-moment-clarity-alcoholics/">argot of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>, medical science is having a “moment of clarity” around alcohol. It turns out that “no level of alcohol consumption is safe for our health,” as the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health">put it in 2023</a>. One <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2802963">major meta-analysis that same year</a> found that there are in fact no mortality benefits at low levels of alcohol consumption, and that risk for a number of health threats rises as consumption increases.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Those <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html">threats include</a> numerous cancers, like breast, colorectal, liver, and esophageal. Even low-level drinking can lead to <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/epdf/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224">increased blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/195880">higher stroke risk</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079224001345">disrupted sleep</a> —&nbsp;which in turn <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/health-risks-of-poor-sleep">can lead to a host of health problems</a> over time. It’s no surprise that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c4b04292-7713-46a4-8963-cd1cef0ce92f">more and more countries</a> — though not yet the US — are giving their citizens official guidance that no level of alcohol consumption can be recommended.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">The decline and fall of teen drinking</h2><p class="has-text-align-none">Whether or not American adults are actually listening to their doctors, the decline in alcohol consumption is real. What’s even more remarkable — and even better news — is the sharper decline in drinking among people who legally shouldn’t be doing it at all: the underage.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">In 2024, <a href="https://isr.umich.edu/news-events/news-releases/missing-rebound-youth-drug-use-defies-expectations-continues-historic-decline/">according to one long-running youth survey</a>, 42 percent of 12th graders reported drinking alcohol, down significantly from 75 percent in 1997 (which happens to be the year I graduated high school, and no, I will not be commenting on which side of the survey I fell on). For 10th graders it was 26 percent (down from 65 percent) and for eighth graders it was 13 percent (down from 46 percent in 1997, which <em>yikes</em>). For those underage Americans who are drinking, the percentage who engage in binge drinking <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt56287/2024-nsduh-annual-national/2024-nsduh-annual-national-html-071425-edited/2024-nsduh-annual-national.htm">has also fallen</a> in recent years, albeit less sharply.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">The benefits of reduced teen drinking are even clearer than they are with adults. About 4,000 Americans under the age of 21 every year <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/underage-drinking/index.html">die from excessive alcohol consumption</a>, whether in car crashes, drownings, or suicides and homicides. Underage drinking is correlated with <a href="https://www.prevention.org/Resources/be6dd650-78f8-43e3-b951-115f044f9cbf/ImpactOfUnderageDrinking-Social%20ConsequencesFINAL.pdf">worse academic performance</a>, <a href="https://www.caron.org/addiction-101/teens-young-adults/underage-drinking-its-impact">risky behavior in general</a>, and an <a href="https://people.com/letting-teens-drink-at-home-can-lead-to-adult-alcohol-use-disorders-11694333">increased chance of alcohol abuse disorder down the line</a>.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Alcohol is really bad — with one caveat</h2><p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s one of the more unbelievable stats I’ve ever seen: scholars believe that <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Alcohol_Related_Violence/ldQLhklj3m0C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=Alcohol-related+crime&amp;pg=PA37&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Alcohol-related%20crime&amp;f=false">something like 40 percent</a> of <em>all murders</em> involve the use of alcohol. That’s just one example of the effects of dangerous levels of alcohol consumption. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/facts-stats/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/features/excessive-alcohol-deaths.html">estimates</a> around 178,000 excess deaths each year from alcohol abuse, of which <a href="https://www.autoinsurance.com/research/drunk-driving-statistics/">over 12,000</a> were deaths in drunk driving accidents — meaning <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving">one out of every three</a> car crash deaths might not have happened without alcohol.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Less alcohol consumption means less of all of this. Fewer violent deaths in drunken homicides or car crashes, and fewer lives cut short over the long term because of alcohol-connected illness. It means fewer families <a href="https://recoverycentersofamerica.com/blogs/substance-use-disorder-divorce-is-there-a-connection/">torn apart by alcohol abuse</a>, and fewer children who <a href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/alcohol/support-recovery/child">endure</a> the long-term trauma of being the child of an alcoholic.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none">If there’s any downside to this drop in drinking, it’s the possibility that the decline is being driven by a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/">decline of socializing more generally</a>. Americans are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/american-loneliness-personality-politics/681091/">spending more time alone than ever before</a>, and that comes with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/social-connectedness/risk-factors/index.html">very serious health and social impacts of its own</a>. We have, oh, several thousand years of evidence that alcohol consumption in moderate, responsible levels is <a href="https://www.pittwire.pitt.edu/pittwire/features-articles/alcohol-online-social-interactions">pretty good for socializing</a>, and right now, many of us need all the help we can get.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, I’m not suggesting everyone stop drinking — or start drinking just to make friends. I myself enjoy a drink, and for now I’m comfortable with the trade-off that comes with moderate drinking. But the benefits to the country overall of less drinking are impossible to dismiss. That’s worth raising a mocktail to.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup">Sign up here!</a></em></p>

	President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, on August 15, 2025. | Andrew Caballero/AFP via Getty Images	</figcaption></figure><p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story appeared in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-logoff-newsletter-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Logoff</a>, a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/logoff-newsletter-trump-administration-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subscribe here</a></em>.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Welcome to The Logoff:</strong> We’re coming to you a little later than normal after the conclusion of a summit between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, today. The two men spoke for almost three hours at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in what Trump described as a “very productive meeting,” but ultimately announced no concrete progress toward ending the Russia-Ukraine war.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do we know so far?</strong> The big headline: There is no Russia-Ukraine peace deal in place, and no temporary ceasefire. Both leaders made only vague remarks about negotiations, suggesting that there could be a long way to go — if there’s a deal to be had at all.</p><p class="has-text-align-none">Trump spoke for just over three minutes, following longer remarks by Putin, and told reporters that “there were many, many points that we agreed on” with a few “big ones” still outstanding; however, he offered no specifics. He also said he would speak with NATO allies and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the meeting, noting it was “ultimately up to them.”&nbsp;</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What comes next?</strong> Trump and Putin are likely to speak again soon, Trump said, and may hold a second summit. It’s unclear if Zelenskyy would attend — Trump has previously expressed hope that he would, but he didn’t comment on that in his remarks Friday evening.</p><p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the context for all this?</strong> Trump returned to office promising to end the conflict within 24 hours of being sworn in; nearly seven months later, it has unsurprisingly proved intractable. Trump has seemed increasingly impatient in recent weeks, including threatening “severe consequences” for Russia if there is no progress toward a deal. On Friday, however, he appeared more conciliatory.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">And with that, it’s time to log off…</h2><p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re looking for a fun long read — and a walk down memory lane — for your weekend, may I recommend Vox’s “<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/422681/pop-culture-explains-25-years-21st-century">The 25 pieces of culture that explain the last 25 years</a>”? Vox&#8217;s culture team tackles the moments, trends, music, movies, and more that have defined the 21st century so far, along with some wonderful illustrations by Vox art director Paige Vickers. As always, thanks for reading, and have a great weekend! </p>
