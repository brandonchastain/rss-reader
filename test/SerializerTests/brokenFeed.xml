I challenged myself to finish books before they were overdue at the library and occasionally pulled it off. Sometimes I drank an entire 8 glasses of water and went to bed by 10:30pm. Sure, we went out. We had uninterrupted conversations. We drank Hugo spritzes. We saw dogs playing in a kiddie pool set up in front of an open fire hydrant and lamented that the kids were missing it, then reloaded their last locations and photos from the camp stream a million more times. We said things to each other like, &#8220;I miss the kids, but not parenting.&#8221; I watched <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mikebirbiglia/video/7532600776175193358">this clip</a> and it emotionally wrecked me.

	High on the list of cooking things that I&#8217;ve got far more opinions on than anyone has ever asked of me (and may have even, at times, prayed I&#8217;d stop yapping about), are homemade ice cream sandwiches. Why? Because it&#8217;s devastating when you realize something that should bring us nothing but incandescent summer joy &#8212; ice cream! cookies! &#8212; rarely work as well as promised. Most cookies become so hard once frozen, you feel like you&#8217;re breaking a tooth with each bite. Unyielding cookies also squeeze the ice cream out the sides, leading to drips down your arms and an immediate bad mood (for adults; kids, naturally, love it).

	I didn&#8217;t mean to get so carried away making focaccia over the last few months, but don&#8217;t I always say that? As if I forget how easily I get consumed with a very specific idea for what a recipe should be and cannot let it go, even when it&#8217;s past time to move on.

	Last summer, a friend came to a barbecue and said, &#8220;We had soccer and then a birthday party and I had no time to make anything but I brought this&#8221; and started unloading items from a grocery bag. There were no clean cooking utensils so she and I proceeded to use our hands to break open balls of burrata and spread them on a plate, smash open cherries and pit them, sprinkling them over, crushed pistachios with the bottom of a pot, and finished the whole platter with olive oil, lots of sea salt, black pepper, and fresh mint we picked from sprigs. We lined the plate with rounds of storebought crostini, I snapped a picture and later when I shared it, dozens of you messaged me to demand a recipe or tutorial.</p><p><a class="more-link" href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2025/07/burrata-with-crushed-cherries-and-pistachios/">Read more <span>&raquo;</span></a></p>

I&#8217;ve filled the french toast vacuum on the site instead with customizations: casserole-style baked french toasts with <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/04/cinnamon-toast-french-toast-cookbook-preview/">cinnamon sugar toast</a> and, uh, <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2006/12/new-years-day-2001/">bailey&#8217;s</a> (ah, the child-free years). There&#8217;s even a fancy french toast akin to <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2011/05/creme-brulee-french-toasts/">individual crème brûlées</a>. But eventually, through a combination of friends texting on random weekend mornings [&#8220;Do you seriously not have a challah french toast recipe?!&#8221;] and the existence of a teenager, who I cannot teach to make french toast for us if I haven&#8217;t written it down, I&#8217;ve come to my senses.

	Do you have a big, neglected cabbage in your fridge awaiting the right inspiration? I had a feeling you did. The way I figure it, the sidewalks are currently covered in pink and white petal confetti, the ramps are here, and the asparagus is close, thus I&#8217;m crossing my fingers that this can be our last hurrah with heavy winter vegetables until at least November.
