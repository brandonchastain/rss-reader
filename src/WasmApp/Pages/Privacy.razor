        <p>
            I respect your personal privacy as much as I do my own. For that reason, you should be aware of the following before using RSS Reader.
        </p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>We will never share or sell any personal data.</h3>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>What data gets stored by RSS Reader?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Microsoft account email address</li>
            <li>Feeds that you subscribe to on RSS Reader</li>
            <li>Feed item metadata (text content, tags, unread posts, saved posts)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You are trusting <strong>me</strong> (Brandon) and the <strong>RSS Reader code &amp; infrastructure</strong> with the above data.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>How is that data used?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This data is used solely for authentication and app functionality.</li>
            <li>No third-party analytics or ad services are provisioned in the infrastructure.</li>
            <li>No data is shared with third parties except Microsoft/Azure as the cloud provider.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Personal Microsoft account required for this website (see alternative options below)</h3>
        <p>
            A personal Microsoft account is required to login to RSS Reader. The only account data we use is the email address. It serves as your username in RSS Reader.<br />
            Microsoft securely handles the authentication when you login from your browser. Your credentials are never exposed to RSS Reader.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>We won't spam you.</h3>
        <p>We don't send any emails at all.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Alternative Options (for the privacy-conscious)</h3>
        <p>
            If you'd like to use RSS Reader but prefer not to disclose any personal data, try one of these options:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use an anonymous Microsoft account (for casual anonymity)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Self-host the app (for absolute privacy) - <a href="https://github.com/brandonchastain/rss-reader/blob/main/README.md">Docs</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Data like email addresses, feeds, and posts are stored on an encrypted Azure Storage Account</li>
            <li>The backend server runs in an Azure Container App (Azure-managed PaaS)</li>
            <li>Error logs are sent to Azure Log Analytics and retained for 30 days.</li>
            <li>All network traffic to the backend is protected by HTTPS to mitigate eavesdropping and tampering.</li>
            <li>The backend server has 2 layers of authentication. For a request to be accepted, it must be sent by an authenticated user (via Microsoft auth) and from an known frontend host (via secret key).</li>
            <li>The backend API prevents users from seeing any data that isn't their own.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
